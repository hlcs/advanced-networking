					<h2>Routing Between VLANs</h2>
					<p>Members of different VLANs are <strong>not able to communicate with each other</strong> at the ISO/OSI Layer 2, using MAC addresses for instance.</p>
					<p>They can still <strong>reach each other with a routing process</strong> performed by a Layer 3 device, such as a multi-layer switch or a router.</p>
					<p>Performing traffic forwarding between otherwise separated VLANs is called <strong>inter-VLAN Routing</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How to Route Between VLANs</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Legacy</strong> - the different VLANs to route would be connected to different physical router interfaces.</li>
						<li><strong>Router-on-a-Stick</strong> - All the VLANs to be routed are connected to the router through a single interface, configured as a trunk link.</li>
						<li><strong>Multi-Layer Switching</strong> - A separate router is replaced by a L3-capable switch, called multi-layer switch, that performs the basic routing function required.</li>
					</ul>

						<h2>Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing</h2>
						<p>Each VLAN that must be routed is <strong>connected to a single, different, physical router interface</strong> that becomes a member of that VLAN.</p>
						<p>In this configuration the switch(es) adjacent to the router have the ports connected to the router interfaces configured in <strong>access</strong> mode.</p>
						<p>The members of each VLAN can then set the <strong>relevant router physical interface as their gateway</strong> to remote networks (and thus, the other VLANs).</p>
						<p>This method <strong>isn’t used anymore</strong>. Routers have very few interfaces and thus are unable to support scenarios with more than a few VLANs.</p>

						<h2>Router-on-a-Stick</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bcOWj5k.png">
						<p>We can let the router perform the routing between several VLANs even if traffic comes in and <strong>out of a single physical interface</strong>: this is called the <strong><em>router-on-a-stick</em></strong> configuration.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Router-on-a-Stick</h2>
						<p>The physical <strong>router interface is configured for a trunk link</strong>, and so is the switch port at the other end of the trunk link, which is configured for allowing all the VLANs to be routed.</p>
						<p>The router interface will have <strong>subinterfaces</strong>, which are virtual, software-defined interfaces that are logically independent but <strong>tied to the same physical interface</strong> for their traffic.</p>
						<p>Each VLAN allowed on the trunk will have <strong>its own subinterface</strong> (configured with the VLAN addressing) assigned to it.</p>
						<p>Thanks to the tag, each subinterface will only see traffic of the VLAN they are assigned to, and route it accordingly.</p>
						<p>Routing-on-a-Stick support <strong>much more VLANs than legacy</strong> inter-vlan routing, but the single link quickly becomes a <strong>bottleneck</strong>.</p>

							<li><code>encapsulation dot1q [vlan_id]</code> - used to assign a router subinterface to a specific VLAN.</li>
							<li><strong>Subinterfaces don’t need to be enabled</strong> with <code>no shutdown</code>, they're <u>all</u> automatically up when their parent interface is.</li>

						<h2>Multi-Layer Switching</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kzZbsMY.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Multi-Layer Switching</h2>
						<p><em>Multi-Layer Switches</em> (MLS) are <strong>switches capable of making forwarding decision at Layer 3</strong>. It is possible to use them for basic routing, both static and dynamic, and inter-vlan routing.</p>
						<p><strong>Routers have limited</strong> number of ports and forwarding rate.</p>
						<p><strong>MLSes perform both switching and <u>routing functions in hardware</u></strong> and so are much faster than routers (millions of packet-per-second vs 100k-1M pps on routers).</p>
						<p>With MLS, there’s <strong>no need for external connections to a router</strong>, because the <strong>traffic is routed internally to the switch</strong>, resulting in improved latencies.</p>
						<p>Also, MLS supports link aggregation between switches, improving bandwidth.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Multi-Layer Switches vs. Routers</h2>
					<p>If MLS have all these advantages, <u>why do we even need routers</u>?</p>
					<p>Being software-based, <strong><u>routers have much more features at a fraction of the cost</u></strong>. MLS are much more expensive.</p>
					<p>For instance: while it's trivial for routers to have WAN connectivity and performing NAT over it, MLSes typically don't have them and require expensive hardware modules for doing NAT in hardware.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>MLS Interfaces: SVIs</h2>
						<p><strong>MLS have two kinds of interfaces</strong>. The first kind is <em>Switch Virtual Interfaces</em> (SVIs).</p>
						<p>An SVI is the <strong>virtual interface of the switch that is associated to a particular VLAN</strong> (but not a specific port) for routing and bridging purposes.</p>
						<p>It is <strong>automatically created when a VLAN is created</strong>, using the same VID.</p>
						<p>SVIs can be used to <strong>provide a gateway</strong> for the VLAN and/or <strong>remote management</strong> of the switches.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>MLS Interfaces: Routed Ports</h2>
						<p>Routed ports are <strong>physical ports of the switch that behave like router physical interfaces</strong>, and are <strong>not associated to a particular VLAN</strong>.</p>
						<p>To configure a port as Routed on a Cisco MLS, the command <code>no switchport</code> is used.</p>
						<p>There is <strong>no Layer 2 functionality</strong>, so L2 protocols like the Spanning Tree Protocols can’t be enabled on routed ports.</p>
						<p>The main difference with classic router interfaces is that <strong>routed ports on a switch can’t have subinterfaces</strong>.</p>
						<p>Routed ports are <strong>mainly used for PtP links to L3 intermediary devices</strong> such MLS, firewalls, routers.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cisco Multi-Layer Switches</h2>
					<p><u>Cisco 2960 only supports static routing</u>, up to 16 static routes, not counting directly connected and default routes.</p>
					<p>To <strong>enable static routing</strong>, execute the <code>sdm prefer lanbase-routing</code> global configuration command and <code>reload</code>.</p>
					<p>Cisco Catalyst 3560 switches supports more extended routing.</p>
					<p>Generally, specific versions of Cisco IOS are available for purchase to <strong>obtain additional routing functionality</strong>.</p>
					<p>Different switch families have <strong>different defaults about whether a port is Routed or a L2</strong> interface/switchport.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Configuring a Multi-Layer Switch</h2>
						<p>Cisco MLS have a <strong>Cisco Switch Database Manager</strong> (<strong>SDM</strong>) that allows to manage <strong><em>templates</em></strong> of switch settings.</p>
						<p>Templates are <strong>pre-defined settings that optimizes the switch hardware towards certain functions</strong>. For example, an administrator might want to privilege L2 functionality over L3, or viceversa.</p>
						<p>To show the default template <em>bias</em>:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Switch# show sdm prefer
 The current template is "default" template.
 The selected template optimizes the resources in
  the switch to support this level of features for
  0 routed interfaces and 255 VLANs.

number of IPv4/MAC security aces:                 0.375K</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Configuring a Multi-Layer Switch</h2>
						<p>To show the <strong>available templates</strong>, use:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Switch(configure)# sdm prefer ?
default               Default bias
dual-ipv4-and-ipv6    Support both IPv4 and IPv6
lanbase-routing       Support both IPv4 and IPv6 static routing
qos                   QoS bias</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Configuring a Multi-Layer Switch</h2>
						<p>To change the template to <code>lanbase-routing</code>, which supports up to 750 static routes:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Switch(config)# sdm prefer lanbase-routing
Changes to the running SDM preferences have been stored, 
but cannot take effect until the next reload.
Use ‘show sdm prefer’ to see what SDM preference is currently active.
Switch(config)# exit
Switch# do reload

						<h2>Troubleshooting Inter-VLAN Routing</h2>
						<p>Whether inter-VLAN routing is implemented through legacy, router-on-a-stick or MLS configurations, <strong>troubleshooting almost always involves correction of these common mistakes</strong>:</p>
						<p><strong>Topology</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Familiarize yourself with the logical topology of the network.</li>
							<li>Check the implementation and the connections.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>VLANs and Ports</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>VLANs to be routed must be present on all switches.</li>
							<li>Access and Trunk switchport mode must be set accordingly.</li>
							<li>Ports must be added to the correct VLAN.</li>
							<li>On routers, don’t be fooled by VLAN IDs being different than subinterfaces IDs!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Troubleshooting Inter-VLAN Routing</h2>
						<p><strong>SVIs</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>IP address and subnet mask  coherent to the addressing scheme.</li>
							<li>[...] <em>line is up, line protocol is up</em>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Routing</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Routing must be enabled.</li>
							<li>If using a dynamic routing protocol, the correct interfaces must be added to the configuration.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Hosts</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>IP address and subnet mask  coherent to the addressing scheme.</li>
							<li>Default GW pointing to their associated SVI or routed port.</li>
						</ul>
