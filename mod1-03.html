					<h2>What is Communication?</h2>
					<p>What are the elements of a communication?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The <strong>message</strong>, of course.
						<li>The <strong>source</strong> of the message, the <em>sender</em>
						<li>The <strong>destination</strong> of the message, the <em>receiver</em>
						<li>The <strong>channel</strong> in which communication occurs.
						<li>The <strong>rules</strong>, or <em>protocols</em> to which both sender and receiver have to agree.
					</ul>
					<p>These elements belongs to every kind of communication.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Rules of a communication</h2>
					<p>By following established <strong>protocols</strong> that governs communications, it is possible to deliver and understand a message reliably.</p>
					<p>There can be many protocols. Each one provides an agreement on the following requirements:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identifying sender and receiver
						<li>Commong language and grammar structures
						<li>Speed and timing
						<li>Confirmation or acknowledgment of delivery
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>What Protocols do</h2>
						<h3>Message Encoding</h3>
						<p><em>Encoding</em> is converting information between two different forms.</p>
						<p><em>Decoding</em> is the reverse process.</p>
						<p>Examples: words -> sounds; bits -> impulses.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What Protocols do</h2>
						<h3>Message Formatting and Encapsulation</h3>
						<p>Now that we have an encoded message, we must send it with appropriate <strong>structure</strong>. <u>Letters</u>' recipient, greeting, content, closing, signature are perfect examples.</p>
						<p>Most of the times is convenient to <em>enclose</em> the message for delivery, like we do with <u>envelopes</u> for letters.</p>
						<p>Enclosing one message format in another is called <strong>Encapsulation</strong>. <strong>De-encapsulation</strong> is the reverse process.</p>
						<p>Computers' envelopes are called <strong>frames</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What Protocols do</h2>
						<h3>Message Size</h3>
						<p>Messages are usually <strong>divided into smaller parts</strong>, suited for how much the receiver can <strong>process at one time</strong>.</p>
						<p>This division process is called <strong>segmenting</strong>.
						<p>Each segment must abide to both a <strong>minimum and maximum</strong> size.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What Protocols do</h2>
						<h3>Message Timing</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Access Method</strong>: <em>when can I speak? what do I do if I speak when others are speaking too?</em></li>
							<li><strong>Flow Control</strong>: <em>how fast/slow and for how long can I speak?</em></li>
							<li><strong>Response Timeout</strong>: <em>how long do I wait for a response before reacting? what is the appropriate reaction when the other party is not responding?</em></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What Protocols do</h2>
						<h3>Message Delivery Options</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Unicast</strong>: one-to-one delivery.
							<li><strong>Multicast</strong>: one-to-many delivery.
							<li><strong>Broadcast</strong>: one-to-all delivery.
						</ul>
						<p>Sometimes the receiver is required to send confirmation (<strong><em>acknowledgment</em></strong> or ack) that it actually received the message.
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Protocols in Stacks: Theory</h2>
					<p><strong>Protocol Suite</strong>: several protocols that needs to interact toghether for a communication to occour.</p>
					<p>This interactions is best thought (<em>model</em>) in terms of <strong>layers</strong> in a <strong>stack</strong>.</p>
					<p>Each upper layer protocols <strong>depends on the functionality</strong> provided by lower level protocols.</p>
					<p><u>Rule of thumb</u>: lower layer protocols are more concerned with <em>moving data</em>, upper layer ones with <em>message content</em>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Protocols in Stacks: Practice</h2>
					<p>We can see the protocol stack model in action even in a <strong>simple communication</strong> between a web server and a browser.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Application Protocol</strong>: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), requesting the right page to the web server.</li>
						<li><strong>Transport Protocol</strong>: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), it helps in splitting a single big page into multiple pieces that can be reassambled.</li>
						<li><strong>Internet Protocol</strong>: IP, it identifies source and destination by address.</li>
						<li><strong>Network Access Protocol</strong>: eg. Ethernet, placing the bits on to the wires.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Protocol Suites</h2>
					<p>Protocol suites can be developed by <strong>a standards organization</strong> or by a <strong>vendor</strong>.</p>
					<p>The TCP/IP Protocol Suite (IP, HTTP, DHCP and others) is a standard-based protocol suite. This means they are freely available to the public for <strong>implementation</strong>.</p>
					<p>Following standards-based protocols allows for <strong>interoperability</strong>. Hw and Sw from different vendors are guaranteed to work together.</p>
					<p>Some protocols are <strong>proprietary</strong>: only one vendor develops, controls and (often) knows how the protocol operates.</p>
				</section>

					<p><small>We will see all of these protocols throughout this course. :)</small></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>TCP/IP Communication Process</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/D98yrCJ.gif">
					<p>Let's see the <strong>simple communication</strong> between a web server sending the requested page to a browser (and the browser displaying it) from a <strong>TCP/IP perspective</strong>.</p>
					<p><u>Data = Web Page</u></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open Standards Organizations</h2>
					<p>Standards are essentials for an open Internet, and they wouldn't happen without <strong>vendor-neutral, non-profit standard organizations</strong>.</p>
					<p>By <strong>producing freely available protocol specifications</strong> they ensure that no single vendor can hold the Internet hostage of their own interests.</p>
					<p>Very often the standards these organizations produce are guaranteed to be <strong><em>royalty-free</em></strong>, which means no payment is due for the patents used in them.</p>

						<h2>The Internet Society</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pNOqOkg.jpg" style="float: right;">
						<p><strong>ISOC</strong> is an ensemble mainly focused on the development of the <strong>technical structure of the Internet</strong>.</p>
						<p>It's governed by a board of 13 respected <strong>individuals</strong>, not tied to any specific company, agency, etc.</p>
						<p>The <strong>IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)</strong> maintain Internet technologies in the form of <strong>RFCs (<em>Requests for Comments</em>)</strong>. The <strong>IRTF (Internet Research Task Force)</strong> is more focused on <strong>forward-thinking research</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>ICANN and IANA</h2>
						<p>The <strong>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</strong> is an organizations originally run by the US Gov. for managing</p>
						<ul>
							<li>IP address allocation,
							<li>domain names
							<li>protocol identifiers
							<li>port numbers
						</ul>
						<p>and <strong>Internet namespaces in general at the higher level</strong>.</p>
						<p>The <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN)</strong> is the non-profit that, over time, has carried over IANA duties under a contract with the US Gov.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IEEE</h2>
						<p>The <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (pronounced <em>I-triple-E</em>) is dedicated to standards and innovation in <strong>electrical engineering and electronics</strong>.</p>
						<p>Its standards <strong>affects whole industries</strong> besides just networking.</p>
						<p>Standard are grouped in <strong>families</strong>, which are referred to by a number, followed by a dot and another number identifying a more specific area and its <strong>working group</strong>.</p>
						<p><strong>IEEE 802</strong> family of standard deals with LANs and MANs. Particularly interesting to us are <strong>802.3 (Ethernet)</strong> and <strong>802.11 (Wireless LAN)</strong> standards.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>ISO</h2>
						<p>The <strong>Internation Organization for Standardization</strong> is the largest developer of standards, covering almost every possible field, products and services.</p>
						<p>ISO is best known in networking for developing the <strong>OSI, Open System Interconnection reference model</strong>.</p>
						<p>Its purposes was to produce a <strong>layered framework for networking protocols</strong> but also applying in a full protocol suite for the Internet. But <strong>TCP/IP already won</strong>...</p>
						<p><strong>ISO 9660</strong> should ring a bell if you ever burned a CD.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIA, TIA, ITU-T</h2>
						<p>The <strong>EIA, Electonic Induestries Alliance</strong>, is best known for standardizing wiring and connectors and <strong>mounting racks</strong>.</p>
						<p>The <strong>TIA, Telecommunications Industry Association</strong>, collaborates with the EIA and produces standards for radio, cellular and satellite equipment, and also VoIP devices.</p>
						<p>The <strong>International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)</strong> is responsible for country codes for international dialing and broadband communication standards.</p>

					<h2>Layered Model</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/a0omhOa.gif" style="width: 33%; height: 33%;">
					<p>A <strong>layered model</strong> for protocols helps to visualize what are their operation and the interactions between them.</p>
					<p>A <strong>protocol model</strong> describes how an actual protocol suite operates. A <strong>reference model</strong> describes no particular suite, focusing on the highest possible level of <strong>abstraction</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
					<p>ISO's intention was to develop a <strong>framework for protocol suites</strong>, and also recommending a <strong>protocol suite for Internetworking</strong>. It was half a success, TCP/IP taking the second half.</p>
					<p>OSI 7 Layers Model, defining <strong>functions, domains and interactions between each layer and the ones directly below and above</strong>, has helped developed all types of protocols and networks.</p>
					<p>Its <strong>7 Layers</strong> are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L1: Physical</h3>
						<p>The Physical Layer deals with the hardware: it describes the mechanics of the actual, practical, <strong>activation and maintainance of a physical connection</strong> for transmitting and receiving digital bits.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L2: Data Link</h3>
						<p>Once you are can trasmit your bits from two points on a common media, they can't be random bits. They need to have a <strong>structure</strong>, they need to <strong>access the channel</strong> reliably. Data link protocols deals with producing the bits into frames for transmission over the physical media.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L3: Network</h3>
						<p>The Network Layer describes protocols to <strong>identify</strong> the end devices that needs to communicate and making individual <strong>packets of data travelling</strong> from one to the other(s).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L4: Transport</h3>
						<p>The transport layer protocols define <strong>how to segment the data</strong> belonging to each communication, transfer them and then reassembling them at the destination end device.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L5: Session</h3>
						<p>The first four layers can successfully deliver data from one end device to another, but it's this layer that allows two applications to <strong>coordinate their dialogue and data exchange</strong>.</p>
						<p>Session layer deals with <strong>authentication</strong>, <strong>authorization</strong> and also <strong>session restoration</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L6: Presentation</h3>
						<p>Applications want to transfer their data, but that raises the problem of having an <strong>established and common way to represent those data</strong>. Session layer takes care of this.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSI Reference Model</h2>
						<h3>L7: Application</h3>
						<p>The Application is the <strong>interface between people and the transmission of data over a network</strong>. It initiates the process of running through the stack of protocols on behalf of the user.</p>
						<p>Making two Application layers speak one another it's the ultimate goal: <strong>process-to-process</strong> communication.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>TCP/IP Protocol Model</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DrBlKz8.gif">
						<p>TCP/IP only defines 4 layers: <strong>Network/Link Access, Internet, Transport and Application</strong>.</p>
						<p>It closely match OSI model in Network and Transport layers, but it aggregates many functions in Network Access and Application layers.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>TCP/IP vs. ISO/OSI</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><u>TCP/IP Network (or Link) Layer</u> roughly includes <u>ISO/OSI L1+L2</u>, but it doesn't go into the same level of detail.</li>
							<li><u>TCP/IP Internet Layer</u> can be mapped to <u>ISO/OSI L3</u>.</li>
							<li><u>TCP/IP Transport Layer is ISO/OSI L4</u>, but also includes some session management from L5.</li>
							<li>The functions of <u>TCP/IP Application Layer</u> are those of <u>L5+L6+L7</u> in the ISO/OSI model.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why Segmenting Data?</h2>
					<p>One long, continuous stream of bits would mean:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Busy channels for a long time
						<li>Full retransmission in case of errors
					</ul>
					<p>Segmenting data into smaller pieces makes them <strong>more managable</strong> and avoids the two issues above.</p>
					<p>By segmenting you then need <strong>multiplexing</strong> to interleave different communication's segments over a channel.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Protocol Data Units (PDU)</h2>
					<p>During the <em>encapsulation</em> process, application data gets <strong>additional information as it passes through layers</strong>.</p>
					<p>After protocols add information to the data, the data as a whole will assume <strong>a form closely related to the protocol</strong>, called PDU (<em>Protocol Data Unit</em>).</p>
					<p>PDUs go by different names at different layers:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Data</strong> - General term for Application Layer
						<li><strong>Segment</strong> - PDU of the Transport Layer
						<li><strong>Packet</strong> - PDU of the Network Layer
						<li><strong>Frame</strong> - PDU of the Data Link Layer
						<li><strong>Bits</strong> - Physical Layer PDU
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Addresses</h2>
						<p>Network and Data Link Layer are those responsible for <strong>uniquely identifying the source and destination</strong> of the data exchange.</p>
						<p>They <strong>both do that using addresses</strong>, but of different kind and for different purposes.</p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xDdU0zT.gif">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Network Address: IP Addresses</h2>
						<p>Network addresses are <strong>logical</strong> addresses (not tied to a specific device) required to deliver <u>a packet</u> from source to destination, either on the same or <strong>different networks</strong>.</p>
						<p><strong>IP addresses</strong> are <u>structured</u> and delivery operates by moving (<em>routing</em>) packets <u>according to their structure</u>.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The <u>network part</u> (192.168.1) is used by router to identify and <strong>reach the destination network</strong>.
							<li>The <u>host part</u> (.1) is used by the <strong>last router</strong> to reach the destination host.
						</ul>
						<p>You need two of those IP addresses: source and destination.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data Link  Address: MAC Addresses</h2>
						<p>Data Link Layer (DLL or L2) addresses, also known as <strong>physical addresses</strong> (tied to the NIC), are used to <strong>reach another network interface in the same network</strong> (<em>link</em>).</p>
						<p>DLL addresses, like <strong>MAC addresses</strong>, have <u>no structure</u>: 00:AA:BB:11:FF:01 and 00:AA:BB:11:FF:02 could be on different planets, for all we know.</p>
						<p>L2 delivery operates on the <u>assumption</u> that end devices can <strong>communicate directly over the same link</strong>, just by sending frames with correct addressing onto the wire.</p>
						<p>You need 2 MAC addresses: source and destination.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

						<h2>Role of L2/L3 Addresses</h2>
						<h3>In the same network</h3>
						<div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tTqWLbM.jpg"></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>L2 Src</strong>: 00:15:5F:3C:A2:68 (PC A NIC)</li>
							<li><strong>L2 Dst</strong>: 00:44:C8:59:12:74 (PC B NIC)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Src</strong>: 192.168.1.3 (PC A IP)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Dst</strong>: 192.168.1.62 (PC B IP)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Role of L2/L3 Addresses</h2>
						<h3>Over different networks (1)</h3>
						<div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tTqWLbM.jpg"></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>L2 Src</strong>: 00:15:5F:3C:A2:68 (PC A NIC)</li>
							<li><strong>L2 Dst</strong>: 00:22:54:28:6F:FA (GW NIC, same net as PC A NIC)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Src</strong>: 192.168.1.3 (PC A IP)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Dst</strong>: 10.87.38.185 (PC C IP)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Role of L2/L3 Addresses</h2>
						<h3>Over different networks (2)</h3>
						<div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tTqWLbM.jpg"></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>L2 Src</strong>: 00:85:CC:D3:E2:34 (GW NIC, same net as PC C)</li>
							<li><strong>L2 Dst</strong>: 00:13:81:FC:F6:1A (PC C NIC)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Src</strong>: 192.168.1.3 (PC A IP, unchanged)</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Dst</strong>: 10.87.38.185 (PC C IP, unchanged)</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Default Gateway</h2>
					<p>A <strong><em>gateway</em></strong> is a host (a router, almost always) in a network that <strong>knows how to reach other (specific) networks</strong>.</p>
					<p>The <strong><em>default gateway</em></strong> is the router to which a host on a network will send <strong>every frame for which it has no specific gateway</strong>.</p>
					<p>The default gateway is <em>presumed</em> to know what to do.</p>
					<p>Default gateway either <strong>routes the packet</strong> to final destination or to another router, called <strong>next hop</strong>.</p>
					<p><u>L2 addressing information is rewritten</u> at every hop.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How do I get to know these addresses?</h2>
					<p>A host needs to <storng>know both the logical and physical addresses of the destination host</strong> to be able to generate and send the frame.</p>
					<p>For IP addresses, you probably know IP addresses on your own network and you enter them <strong>manually</strong>.</p>
					<p>For remote networks, you can learn IP address by configuring you r device to use <strong>DNS</strong> (<em>Domain Name System</em>).</p>
					<p>Remembering MAC Addresses would be much more trickier, but fortunally <strong>ARP</strong> (<em>Address Resolution Protocol</em>) relieves you of that need.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why Don't We Go MAC-only?</h2>
						<p>Think about it: we have <u>2 different sets of addresses both able to globally and uniquely identify hosts</u>. Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>MAC addresses makes sense to use because you can't really skip <em>communicating in the same network</em>.</li>
							<li>For MAC addresses to work globally, every router <u>would need to know every MAC address ever released</u>. Sloooow.</li>
							<li>It would not be possible to shorten that list by <u>"grouping" MAC addresses: there is no criteria/structure</u> to do it.</li>
							<li>You <u>can't move a MAC address</u> from a host to another.</li>
							<li>There are <u>L2 protocols other than Ethernet</u>, you know...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why Don't We Go IP-only?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Actually, <em>we could</em>. There are vocal proposal for networking based on L3-only addressing.</li>
							<li>There are <u>not enough IPv4 addresses for every NIC</u>. <strong>IPv6 would solve this</strong>, but we've been stuck with v4 for 30y+.</li>
							<li>Also, <u>checking MAC addresses used to be much faster than checking IPs</u> (because of the lack of structure to analyze), but <strong>not anymore</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>If we started from scratch today, we could probably just use IPs</strong>.</p>
						<p>The reality is that the <strong>Ethernet+IP model has been working pretty well</strong> for ~40 years and almost everything has been based on it. So the urge to change it's minimal.</p>
