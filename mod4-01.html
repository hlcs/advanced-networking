					<h2>Network Requirements</h2>
					<p>Cisco categorized networks <strong>based on host number</strong> in:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Small</strong> network - up to 200 devices.</li>
						<li><strong>Medium</strong> network - 200 to 1000 devices.</li>
						<li><strong>Large</strong> network - More than 1000 devices.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Different network sized means <strong>different requirements</strong>. It is the job of the <strong>network designer</strong> to handle their complexities.</p>
					<p>Cisco has a certification dedicated to network design skills, which encompass a great deal of knowledge. It’s the <strong>CCDA, <em>Cisco Certified Design Associate</em></strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>[R] Design Good Principles</h2>
					<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
					<p>Deploying complex systems in smaller and more manageable <em>tiers</em>, each with a clear role and structure.</p>
					<h3>Modularity</h3>
					<p>Separating <strong>functions in modules</strong> (such as Cisco’s campus, service block, data center, internet edge) to make design easier.</p>
					<h3>Resiliency</h3>
					<p>Network <strong>reacts well to changes</strong>, growth, faults, abnormalities.</p>
					<h3>Flexibility</h3>
					<p>Expansions, improvements, upgrades at any tier are made as easy as possible, <strong>without the need for major operations</strong>.</p>

						<h2>[R] Access, Distribution, Core</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ugMjfRW.jpg">
						<p>Tiers In a Cisco network architecture are <em><strong>Access, Distrubution and Core</strong></em>, usually deployed in a 3-tier or 2-tier (with <em>collapsed</em> Distribution/Core) framework.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>[R] Access, Distribution, Core</h2>
						<p>Tiers In a hyerarchical network architectures are <strong><em>Access</em></strong>, <strong><em>Distribution</em></strong> and <strong><em>Core</em></strong>, usually deployed in a 3-tier or 2-tier (with collapsed Distribution/Core) framework.</p>
						<p>Main advantages: <strong>local traffic stays local</strong>; better boundary separation (perfect for limiting broadcast or filter traffic).</p>
						<p><strong>Traffic starts in the <em>access</em> layer</strong>, which is the layer enabling a local network. Traffic can be <strong>distributed to different local networks</strong> by going through the distribution layer.</p>
						<p>If required, a third layer (core) is provided as the backbone, to <strong>connect distant networks at speeds similar to the local ones</strong>.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- [R] mod2-01.html -->
				<section>
					<h2>[R] Access Layer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's the network edge, where <strong>traffic enters or exits it</strong>.</li>
						<li>It's also where devices that <strong>extend the network out one more level</strong> are placed - like IP phones, wireless APs, WAN connectivity.</li>
						<li>It's primary function is to provide <strong>access to the network for most users</strong> (and thus generic computing devices, end stations access here).</li>
						<li>This is the layer where <strong>most traffic originates</strong> from.</li>
						<li>It provides the <strong>demarcation</strong> between the network infrastructure and the computing devices that leverage it.</li>
						<li>The traditional focus at the access layer is <strong>minimizing <em>cost-per-port</em></strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- [R] mod2-01.html -->
				<section>
					<h2>[R] Distribution Layer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's the most "smart" layer, <strong>implementing network foundation technologies</strong> like routing, advanced switching, filtering, QoS.</li>
						<li><strong>Interface</strong> between Access and Core Layers:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Aggregation point for access switches</strong> (wiring closet).</li>
							<li><strong>Aggregating L2 broadcast domains and L3 routing and summarization boundaries</strong> for network control plane protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, Spanning Tree).</li>
							<li><strong>Demarcation and isolation</strong> between the campus distribution building block and the rest of the network.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Very little traffic originates</strong> directly from here.</li>
						<li><strong>High availability</strong> through redundant distribution layer switches and <strong>equal cost paths to the core</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- [R] mod2-01.html -->
				<section>
					<h2>[R] Core Layer (Backbone)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Very limited set of services, provides <u>24/7 always-on</u> (<em>Fault Isolation</em>) connectivity <u>across the entire network</u> (<em>end-to-end</em> connectivity).</li>
						<li>Basically <strong>no traffic originates</strong> from here.</li>
						<li>It serves as the <strong>aggregator</strong> for the other campus blocks and ties the campus together with the rest of the network.</li>
						<li>Very little decisions about traffic, just <u>collects as much as possible, moves it as fast and reliably as possible</u>.</li>
						<li>So: <strong>high-speed, high-redundancy forwarding</strong> services between "regions" (campus) of the network.</li>
						<li>That means the <strong>most powerful switches</strong> and routers, capable of the fastest connections (e.g. 10 GiB Ethernet)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>2-Tier Collapsed Core Design</h2>
					<p>Sometimes, in small enterprise networks, we can find another design. This design use only two layers with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Access Layer</li>
						<li>Collapsed Core Layer: <strong>a layer with the function of distribution and core</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This design is more cheap than the 3 layer model, saves more hardware (because distribution and core functions are provided in a single device), but mantains much of the benefit of it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Modular Network Design</h2>
					<p>In a modular network design, <strong>networks are separated into blocks</strong> (or <em>modules</em>) <strong>depending on their function</strong>.</p>
					<p>Modules will then have <strong>different physical and/or logical connectivity</strong> in the overall network design.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In the event of a failure, <strong>the fault is easily isolated and detected</strong> in a single module.</li>
						<li>Upgrades, changes, maintenance of the network can be <strong>staged progressively module by module</strong>.</li>
						<li>Modules can be updated or <strong>completely replaced without the need to redesign the network</strong>, not even part of it.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The modular network design reference recommended by Cisco is the <strong><em>Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model</em></strong>.</p>

						<h2>Enterprise Network Arch.</h2>
						<p>It is defined on top of the hierarchical structure, and it's <strong>based on functional blocks</strong>.</p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6Ajvmzo.png" style="width: 650px;">
						<small>Includes the <strong>access, distribution and core layers</strong> in a <em>Campus Infrastructure Module</em>. The word <em>Campus</em> is common but loosely defined in Cisco’s literature.</small>
					</section>
					<!-- [R] mod3-01.html -->
					<section>
						<h2>[R] Enterprise Campus</h2>
						<p>Includes the <strong>access, distribution and core layers</strong> in a <em>Campus Infrastructure Module</em>.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Access</strong> - L2/L3 switches with needed port density.</li>
							<li><strong>Access</strong> - VLANs, trunks, redundant links to distribution.</li>
							<li><strong>Distribution</strong> - L3 devices to aggregate campus access</li>
							<li><strong>Distribution</strong> - Routing, QoS, security</li>
							<li><strong>Core</strong> - High-speed backbone connectivity between</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Distribution Modules</li>
								<li>Server and DataCenter Farms (Network Management)</li>
								<li>Service Module (IP Telephony, wireless controllers, unified services)</li>
								<li>Enterprise Edge</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<!-- [R] mod3-01.html (partial) -->
					<section>
						<h2>[R] Enterprise Edge</h2>
						<p>All the modules that <strong>extends the enterprise network to the outer networks</strong>, like remote sites, partner’s Intranets, and of course the Internet.</p>
						<p>Obviously, it also <strong>enables the campus to provide its services</strong> to outer networks. So its submodules are:</p>
						<small>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>E-Commerce</strong></li>
								<ul>
									<li>Networks and servers to provide e-commerce through the Internet. It’s a critical enough activity to deserve its own modules.</li>
								</ul>
								<li><strong>Internet</strong> and <strong><em>Demilitarized Zone</em></strong> (DMZ)</li>
								<ul>
									<li>It provides <strong>internal users with Internet connectivity</strong>. It also enabled a DMZ, which is <strong>a part of a local network trusted with access from external parties</strong> (typically to provide Internet-facing services).</li>
								</ul>
								<li><strong>WAN</strong> modules</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Devices implementing the WAN technologies in use by the enteprise to connect the campus to remote sites.</li>
								</ul>
								<li><strong>VPN</strong> and <strong>Remote Access</strong></li>
								<ul>
									<li>Authentication and access to the local network for remote users.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
						</small>
					</section>
					<!-- [R] mod3-01.html (partial) -->
					<section>
						<h2>[R] Service Provider Edge</h2>
						<p>Provides the <strong>connectivity solutions that power the enterprise edge</strong>, such as</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Internet (perhaps <em>multi-homed</em>, meaning 2 or more ISPs)</li>
							<li>PSTN (traditional telephony)</li>
							<li>Wide Area Networking (Frame Relay, ATM, MetroEthernet)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All data entering and exiting these connectivity solution <strong>passes through a corresponding edge device in the Enterprise Edge</strong>.</p>
						<p>It is therefore the perfect place to insepect traffic with <em>intrusion detection</em> (IDS) and <em>intrusion prevention</em> (IPS) systems.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Service Provider Edge Redundancy</h2>
						<p>Redundancy/failover by <strong>multiple connections to ISPs</strong> can be:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Single-homed</strong> - Single connection to a single ISP</li>
							<li><strong>Dual-homed</strong> - 2+ connections to a single ISP</li>
							<li><strong>Multihomed</strong> - Connections to 2+ ISPs</li>
							<li><strong>Dual-multihomed</strong> - Multiple connections to 2+ ISP</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Remote Functional Area</h2>
						<p>The type of areas that might need <strong>remote access to the campus local</strong> networks are categorized by their functions in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Enterprise Branch</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>A remote site belonging to the enterprise that allows employees to work on <strong>campus resources from a non-campus location</strong>.</li>
								<li>Enabling edge devices can be WAN interfaces, or Internet+VPN as a backup.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Remote Functional Area</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Enterprise Teleworker</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>It enables to provide connectivity to employees that want or <strong>need to work from disperse locations</strong>, including non-enterprise ones such as homes, hotel, customer sites.</li>
								<li>To enable edge devices: mostly local ISP connection + VPN.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>Enterprise Data Center</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Same functions as campus data center, but in a remote location.</li>
								<li>Enabling edge devices are mostly fast WAN services like MetroEthernet, enabling <strong>(a)synchronous data+app replication</strong>.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Cisco Enterprise Architecture</h2>
						<p>New technologies as</p>
						<ul>
							<ul>
								<li>Cloud</li>
								<li>Internet of the things (IoT)</li>
								<li>Online collaboration</li>
								<li>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>were a great challenge for network designer, because <strong>they make the border between networks’ components, areas, responsibilities and policies less clear</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Cisco Enterprise Architecture</h2>
							<p>Use scenarios change along with new technologies and the designer works to <strong>implement them without disrupting existing networks</strong>. To help designers Cisco has introduced 3 new network architectures</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Cisco Borderless Network Architecture</li>
								<li>Collaboration Architecture</li>
								<li>Data Center/Virtualization Architecture</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Borderless Network Arch.</h2>
					<p>It’s a complete solution by Cisco to armonize <strong>the use of personal devices in the enterprise network</strong>.</p>
					<p>It enables IT departments to configure personal devices in a seamless fashion, to <strong>bring them in compliance with the network policies</strong>, enabling employees to work with them.</p>
					<p>A practical example: <em>how can personal devices such as laptop, tablets, phones, with many different operating system, can be easily configured to connect securely and easily to the enterprise network</em>?</p>
					<p>The Cisco’s answer is using a multiplatform software developed for these end-devices, called <strong>Cisco AnyConnect</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Collaboration Architecture</h2>
						<p><strong><em>Groupware</em></strong> are software applications that are <strong>meant to be used by more than one user</strong> to achieve their purpose.</p>
						<p>Applications that let people <strong>collaborate to produce something</strong> (think of <em>Google Doc</em>) are an example.</p>
						<p>Cisco has a 3-layer architecture to <strong>enable the creation and implementation of collaboration application</strong>:</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Collaboration Architecture</h2>
						
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ready to use applications and devices</strong></li>
