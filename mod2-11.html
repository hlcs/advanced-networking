					<h2>[R] RFC 1918: IPv4 Private Address Space</h2>
					<p>In <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a>, several subnets from the whole IPv4 address space has been <strong>reserved for private use</strong>. They are the:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>10/8 address space (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255).</li>
						<li>172.16/12 address space (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255).</li>
						<li>192.168/16 address space (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255).</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Reserved for private use</em> implies that these addresses:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>are reserved for use in local network(s) within sites belonging to an entity or organization.</li>
						<li>don't have to be assigned from an authority and thus...</li>
						<li>... they don't have to be globally unique. This is possible because...</li>
						<li>... these addresses <strong>are not routable on the Internet</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv4 Address Depletion</h2>
					<!-- Maybe "map ip address to another" is better? -->
					<p><strong>The entire IPv4 address space consists of a little more than 4 billion addresses</strong>. It seemed more than enough, but the incredible growth of the Internet proved this assumption wrong.</p>
					<p>Without a solution, all the IPv4 addresses would have been exhausted way before year 2000.</p>
					<p><strong>IPv6 solves this</strong> problem, but only in the long term.</p>
					<p>RFC 1918 allows to conserve a huge amount of public Internet addresses, but it has to be <strong>coupled with a mechanism to provide these private networks with access to the public Internet</strong>.</p>
					<p>This mechanism is the <strong><em>Network Address Translation</em></strong> (<strong>NAT</strong>).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is NAT and Why We use It</h2>
					<p><strong><em>Network Address Translation</em></strong> is a technique used in a routing device that <strong>rewrites the source and/or destination IP address of a packet</strong> before forwarding it.</p>
					<p>Its main and most important use is to allow private networks to access the Internet, by replacing their RFC 1918 addresses with public IPv4 addresses.</p>
					<p>To do this, it will use a set of one or more public IPv4 addresses (the <em>NAT pool</em>) that are configured on the NAT-enabled router.</p>
					<p>These public IPv4 addresses are those assigned by the ISP, or directly assigned to an organization by an Internet Registry.</p>
					<p>We are using NAT <u>right now</u>.</p>

						<h2>NAT: Basic Operations</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dn8PygJ.gif">
						<p>NAT builds <strong><em>mappings</em> between one address and another</strong> and use them to translate incoming and outgoing traffic.</p>
						<p>It is therefore a two-way process.</p>
						<p>These mappings are stored to/consulted from a <strong>NAT table</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT: Basic Operations</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MwCKvH8.gif">
						<ul>
							<li>The figure shows an <strong>example translation</strong> for outgoing traffic.</li>
							<li>The process is reversed for the reply.</li>
							<li>In this simple example, the NAT pool is a single address.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT: Basic Operations</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xTLlucx.gif">
						<ul>
							<li>Because of the NAT process, an outside network (like the Internet) sees the <strong>all the hosts on the <em>masqueraded</em> network as they are a single one</strong>, source/destination of all traffic.</li>
							<li><strong>NAT hides the details of the internal network</strong> from the outside perspective.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT Terms</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IH0GRtg.png">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Inside/Outside</strong> - These attributes for an address involved in the NAT process refer to its <em>location</em>. They are the answer to the question "<em>On which side of the NAT-enabled router this address logically exist</em>?".</li>
							<li><strong>Local/Global</strong> - These attributes for an address involved in the NAT process refer to the <em>perspective</em> being used. They are the answer to the question "<em>Who is observing this address</em>?"</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT Terms</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Inside local</strong> - Address of inside host as seen from the inside.</li>
							<li><strong>Inside global</strong> - Address of inside host as seen from the outside.</li>
							<li><strong>Outside local</strong> - Address of outside host as seen from the inside.</li>
							<li><strong>Outside global</strong> - Address of outside host as seen from the outside.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The definitions <strong>only depends on the NAT operations</strong>, and are therefore valid for both outgoing and incoming traffic.</p>
						<p>Almost always (and in every case we'll see), <strong>outside local and outside global addresses coincide</strong>.</p>
						<p>Generally, local addresses are in the private IPv4 space and global addresses are in the public IPv4 space. However, <strong>NAT is a mechanism that can work for any pair of addresses</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT Terms</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MwCKvH8.gif">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Inside local</strong> - 192.168.0.12</li>
							<li><strong>Inside global</strong> - 203.31.220.134</li>
							<li><strong>Outside local</strong> - 135.250.24.10</li>
							<li><strong>Outside global</strong> - 135.250.24.10</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>NAT Types</h2>
					<p>There are several types of NAT based on how the <strong>mappings between local and global addresses</strong> in the NAT table are produced. </p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Static NAT</strong> - One-to-one mapping.</li>
						<li><strong>Dynamic NAT</strong> - Many-to-many mapping.</li>
						<li><strong>NAT Overloading</strong> - Many-to-one mapping. It is also known as <em>Port Address Translation (PAT)</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static NAT</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LG9bpHl.gif">
						<ul>
							<li>In Static NAT, <strong>each local address is statically mapped by the administrator to a single global address</strong>.</li>
							<li>This means that the number of public addresses must <strong>at least match</strong> the number of inside hosts to be NATted. </li>
							<li>These mappings remain fixed as configured by the admin.</li>
							<li>Ideal when having <strong>inside hosts that needs to be accessible from the Internet</strong> using reliable public addressing.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static NAT - Operations</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/S5o1cl8.gif">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static NAT - Configuration</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Specify a static mapping between a local and a global address.</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat inside source static {local_ip global_ip}</code></pre>
							<li>Mark the <em>inside interface</em> of the NAT.</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# interface [id]
Router(config-if)# ip nat inside
Router(config-if)# exit</code></pre>
							<li>Mark the <em>outside</em> interface of the NAT.</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# interface [id]
Router(config-if)# ip nat outside
Router(config-if)# exit</code></pre>
							<li>Repeat for each address to be statically mapped.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static NAT - Verification</h2>
						<p>To show <strong>currently active translations</strong> (static one are always reported in the NAT table):</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# show ip nat translations
Pro Inside global   Inside local   Outside local   Outside global
--- 203.31.218.208  192.168.0.1    160.97.54.39    160.97.54.39
--- 203.31.218.209  192.168.0.2    ----            -----
--- 203.31.218.210  192.168.0.3    149.3.176.11    149.3.176.11</code></pre>
						<p>To verify that the NAT is working, we can check how many translation have occured:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# clear ip nat statistics
Router# show ip nat statistics
Total active translations: 3 (3 statics, 0 dynamic; 0 extended)
Peak translations: 2, occured 00:01:37 ago
Outside interfaces:
   Serial 0/0/0
Inside interfaces:
   Serial 0/1/0
Hits: 6 Misses: 0</code></pre>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Dynamic NAT</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DN169eS.gif">
						<ul>
							<li>Dynamic NAT works very similarly to Static NAT, except that <strong>the administrator doesn't configure the mapping explicitely</strong>.</li>
							<li>Instead, the global addresses available (must be enough to match inside hosts) are <strong>added into a <em>NAT pool</em></strong>.</li>
							<li>The available one-to-one mappings are assigned on a <em>first come, first served</em> basis, resulting in many-to-many mappings.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Dynamic NAT - Configuration</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Create the NAT pool that will be used for translation:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat pool {name start_ip end_ip} [netmask mask | prefix-length prefix]</code></pre>
							<li>Allow inside hosts to be translated in a specific ACL:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# access-list {acl_num} permit {source_ip} [source_wildcard]</code></pre>
							<li>Bind the ACL to the pool </li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat inside source list {acl_num} pool {name}</code></pre>
							<li>Mark <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em> interfaces:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# interface [id]
Router(config-if)# ip nat inside
Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)# interface [id]
Router(config-if)# ip nat outside</code></pre>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Dynamic NAT - Verification</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>To show active static translations and dyamic ones created when allowed host wants to reach outside networks:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# show ip nat translations
Router# show ip nat translations verbose</code></pre>
							<li>By default, dynamic translations expire after 24h. To edit this timeout:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat translation timeout [seconds]</code></pre>
							<li>To erase dynamic translations in the NAT table (<strong>static translations can't be deleted)</strong>:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# clear ip nat translation *
Router(config)# clear ip nat translation inside {glo_ip loc_ip} [outside loc_ip glo_ip]</code></pre>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>PAT - Port Address Translation</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/W6THnd6.gif">
						<ul>
							<li>PAT (<em>NAT Overloading</em>) doesn't use static mappings or NAT pools, because multiple inside hosts are <strong>translated with a single global address</strong>.</li>
							<li>By far <strong>the most common form of NAT</strong>, typical of home routers.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>PAT - Overloading with Source Ports</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Using a single address, it would be <strong>impossible to distinguish</strong> NAT translations.</li>
							<li>PAT solves this ambiguity by <strong>using the TCP/UDP source ports to identify specific translations</strong>. </li>
							<li>The NAT table will keep track of the source port used by the inside hosts.</li>
							<li>When a reply comes with <strong>that port as destination port on the single inside global address</strong>, the router will use it to match the traffic to the right translation.</li>
							<li>PAT also checks that replies belong to <em>established</em> connections.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>PAT - Available Ports</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>PAT <strong>tries no to alter the source port number</strong> during translation and merely keeps track of it in the NAT table.</li>
							<li>If there's an host with an already active translation using the same port, <strong>PAT must change it to the next available port</strong>.</li>
							<li>This <em><strong>connection tracking</strong></em> based on private/public source ports pair only works for TCP and UDP. For other protocols, <strong>PAT must rely on a protocol-specific identifier</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>For instance, ICMPv4 Echo Requests and Replies include a <em>Query ID</em> that can be used to uniquely <em>overload</em> multiple hosts to a single inside global address.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>PAT - Configuration</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Allow inside hosts to be translated in a specific ACL:</li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# access-list {acl_num} permit {source_ip} [source_wildcard]</code></pre>
							<li>Bind the ACL to the pool </li>
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat inside source list {acl_num} interface {id} overload</code></pre>
							<li>Mark <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em> interfaces:</li>
						</ol>
						<p><strong>PAT can also be used to translate using more than one address</strong>: the needed variation are the creation of the pool</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat pool {name start_ip end_ip} [netmask mask | prefix-length prefix]</code></pre>
						<p>and the enabling of NAT overloading on the pool:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat inside source list {acl_num} pool {name} overload</code></pre>
						<p>For PAT, <code>show ip nat translations</code> also show the port numbers involved in the translations.</p>

						<h2>NAT Advantages</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The obvious: it can <strong>conserve many addresses</strong>.</li>
							<li>Increases flexibility and performance in connections to outside networks, enabling <em>load balancing</em> using multiple pools.</li>
							<li>With NAT, a change in the public IPv4 address scheme is much simpler because <strong>readdressing</strong> is an operation <strong>performed on fewer hosts</strong> and on address pools: the bulk of the network keeps its private IPv4 addresses.</li>
							<li>Thanks to the NAT, the network can <strong>hide addressing and topology details</strong> and it's a first stage of access control.  Keep in mind that NAT are not a replacement for firewalls and proper security.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>NAT Disadvantages</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Hosts on the <strong>outside network cannot initiate connection</strong> with hosts behind a NAT.</li>
							<li>NAT is a very <strong>resourceful process</strong> because every packet to/from the outside network needs to be analyzed and rewritten.</li>
							<li>If a protocol requires <strong>end-to-end addressing</strong>, or relies on IPv4 addresses (like IPsec does for security), it <strong>won't work behind a NAT</strong>.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gHHOxrc.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>
						<p>Because NAT hides internal addresses, <strong>P2P only works from the inside out</strong> where NAT can map outgoing requests against incoming replies.</p>
						<p>The problem is that NAT does not allow requests initiated from the outside. Is is possible to mitigate this problem through <strong>manual intervention</strong> with <em>port forwarding</em>.</p>
						<p>Port forwarding is the act of forwarding <strong>a network port from one network node to another</strong>, allowing an external user to reach a port on a private IPv4 address (inside a LAN) from the outside, through a NAT-enabled router.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Port Forwarding: Configuration</h2>
						<p>Port Forwarding is very similar to static NAT, only with the a TCP or UDP port number added as a parameter.</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ip nat inside source static {tcp | udp local_ip local_port global_ip global_port} </code></pre>
						<p>As usual, <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em> interfaces need to be marked as such.</p>
						<p>Basically <strong>every home router</strong> includes a section about port forwarding.</p>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv6 and NAT</h2>
					<p>IPv6 has an unconceivable number of addresses available, so address exhaustion is not an issue. NAT, as conceived for IPv4, <strong>is not needed in IPv6</strong>.</p>
					<p>In fact, IPv6 was the long term solution that NAT wasn't, and so is designed not to need NAT.</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, <strong>IPv6 has both NAT and private address space</strong>, but they are <strong>implemented for entirely different reasons</strong> and in an entirely different way.</p>
					<p>NAT for IPv6 (for which there are several mechanism) is used as a <strong>temporary mechanism to aid migration from IPv4</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv6 Unique Local Addresses</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PR2topB.png">
					<p>IPv6 ULA (RFC 4193), also known as <em>local IPv6 addresses</em> are the closest thing there is to RFC 1918 in the IPv6 protocol.</p>
					<p>ULAs have a prefix of FC00::/7 (so a first hextet range from FC00 to FDFF).</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Meant to be used for privately interconnected site, in order to <strong>maintain addressing independence</strong> from a central authority.</li>
						<li><strong>Not routable across the Internet</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
