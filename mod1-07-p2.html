						<h2>Transition to IPv6</h2>
						<p>An upgrade from IPv4 was badly needed for several reasons (address space exhaustion, performances, extendibility).</p>
						<p>This upgrade is <strong>IPv6</strong> and has been in the works since 1993 and has been ready for several years.</p>
						<p>However the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will be slow and take years, so for a long time <strong>the two protocols will coexist</strong>, thanks to several <strong>transition mechanisms</strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Dual Stack</strong>: every host on the network runs both IPv4/6.</li>
							<li><strong>Tunneling</strong>: IPv6 packets encapsulated inside IPv4 packets.</li>
							<li><strong>Translation</strong>: NAT64 translates IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets, and viceversa.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>[E] Transition to IPv6: Dual Stack</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k3f0jsb.jpg">
						<ul>
							<li>If (an) <u>entire route between two networks</u> runs <strong>both IPv4/IPv6</strong>, their hosts can use IPv6-only between them.</li>
							<li>For two networks, <strong>IPv6 routing could use different routes than IPv4</strong> routing.</li>
							<li>IPv6 is growing, but <strong>only a fraction of the Internet is running on IPv6</strong>.</li>
							<li>As of now, even if the entire path is dual stack, often <strong>IPv4 has priority</strong> (it's just easier this way).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>[E] Transition to IPv6: Tunneling</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GhiQBhC.jpg">
						<ul>
							<li>To traverse an IPv4-only network, a tunnel is created that <strong>makes it transparent to dual-stack hosts</strong>.</li>
							<li>It's an IP-IP tunnel, precisely an <em>IPv6-in-IPv4</em> tunnel.</li>
							<li><u>IPv6 packets are encapsulated inside IPv4 packets</u>, which are able to traverse the IPv4-only networks.</li>
							<li>At the end of the tunnel, the (de-encapsulated) IPv6 layer 3 takes the place of the IPv4 L3.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>[E] Transition to IPv6: NAT64</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cMLFJfE.jpg">
						<ul>
							<li>If IPv4 hosts need <strong>to traverse IPv6-only networks</strong>, an <em>IPv4-in-IPv6</em> tunnel is definitely a possibility.</li>
							<li>However, IPv6 has an explicit <strong>translation capability</strong> that can be used for this purpose: <strong>NAT64</strong> translates IPv4 addresses into corresponding IPv6 addresses.</li>
							<li>Notice that <u>NAT64 is not about preserving addresses</u>, as it's the case with NAT for IPv4.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>IPv6 Address Format</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Xf426J.gif" style="width: 600px;">
						<p>An IPv6 address is <strong>128 bits long</strong>. It's not expressed with 16 decimal values, but instead <strong>32 hexadecimal digits</strong> are used. Example: 2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004.</p>
						<p>Each group of 16 bits/4 hex digits (unofficially called an <em>hextet</em>) is <strong>separated by a colon</strong> (<code>:</code>) instead of a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>
						<p>It's made of a <strong>Network Prefix</strong> (network part) and <strong>Interface ID</strong> (host part).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Preferred Format</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Xf426J.gif" style="width: 700px;">
						<p>When we use all 32 hex digits to write an IPv6 address, we are using the <strong><em>preferred format</em></strong>.</p>
						<p>It's not always ideal to use this many digits :(</p>
						<p>But! There are rules to <strong>simplify the format</strong> than can be used often (but now always).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Simplifying IPv6 Address Format</h2>
						<h3>Rule 1: Omitting Leading 0s</h3>
						<p>Any <strong>leading</strong> 0s in any of the hextets can be stripped out.</p>
						<pre>Preferred - 2001:0DB8:0000:1110:0000:0000:0000:0230

						<p>You <u>must not</u> strip the <strong>trailing</strong> 0s.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Simplifying IPv6 Address Format</h2>
						<h3>Rule 2: Omitting All-0s</h3>
						<p>Any <strong>contiguos</strong> string of one or more hextets that consists of <strong>all-0s</strong> can be replaced by a <u>single</u> double colon (<code>::</code>).</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">YOU CAN ONLY USE THE :: _ONCE_ IN A IPv6 ADDRES!!!

					<h2>IPv6 Addresses</h2>
					<p>In IPv6 too there are <strong>unicast</strong> and <strong>multicast</strong> addresses. It also has <strong>anycast</strong> addresses, which are <strong>assignable to multiple hosts</strong> and <strong>routed to the nearest</strong> one.</p>
					<p><strong>IPv6 has no broadcast addresses</strong>. It achieves the same effect with a particular multicast address called <em>all-nodes</em>.</p>
					<p>IPv6 doesn't use dotted notation for subnet masks. Instead <strong>it uses prefix lengths/slash notation ranging from 0 to 128</strong>.</p>
					<p>A typical network prefix for IPv6 networks is /64:</p>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/I2rCANR.gif">
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Unicast Addresses</h2>
						<p>As in IPv4, in IPv6 transmissions the <strong>source address must be an unicast address</strong> that uniquely identifies that interface.</p>
						<p>There are 6 types of IPv6 unicast addresses:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Global Unicast</strong>: Similar to <u>public</u> IPv4 Internet addresses, globally unique and routable.</li>
							<li><strong>Link-Local</strong>: Used only for tranmission to other IPv6 hosts on the same link (subnet). They only must be unique in a single link, because <u>IPv6 router will never forward packets with link-local addresses</u>.  Their range is <code>FE80::/10</code> - <code>FEBF::/10</code></li>
							<li><strong>Loopback</strong>: The IPv6 loopback address is <code>::1/128</code> or <code>::1</code>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Unicast Addresses</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Unspecified</strong>: It's the <u>all-0s address</u>, <code>::/128</code> or <code>::</code>. It can't be assigned, and only used as source address by hosts yet to have IPv6 configured or when the source is irrelevant.</li>
							<li><strong>Unique Local (ULA)</strong>: They are the <u>IPv6 counterpart of RFC 1918 Private Addresses</u>. ULAs are available for use in private networks, inside a single site or organization or spanning a limited number of sites. They are not routable in the global IPv6 Internet. The allocated block for ULAs is <code>fc00::/7</code> - <code>fdff::/7</code></li>
							<li><strong>IPv4 Embedded</strong>: a particular type of address to help the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. They are, in fact, <u>IPv6 addresses that contain an IPv4 address</u> in the last 4 bytes.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv6 Link-Local Communications</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3QmNjli.png">
					<p>IPv6 <strong>supports multiple IPv6 addresses</strong> on an interface, and <u>at least one of them</u> <strong>must be a link-local address</strong>.</p>
					<p>If it is not configured statically, it will be calculated automatically by the host without the need for DHCP.</p>
					<p>It will be used to communicate <strong>with other IPv6 hosts on the same link/subnet</strong>, <u>including the default gw</u>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Global Unicast Address</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LGVfYS4.png">
						<p>These are the <strong>IPv6 Internet-routable addresses</strong>, assigned by the IANA to the RIRs and then to the users. As of now, only addresses starting with <code>2000::/3</code> (first 3 bits 001) are being assigned.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Global Unicast Address</h2>
						<p>A global unicast address is made of 3 components:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Global Routing Prefix</strong>: Currently RIR assigns IPv6 blocks with a /48 routing prefix.</li>
							<li><strong>Subnet ID</strong>: A field available for assignees of a GRP block to define their subnets/sites.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>GRP + Subnet ID must be 64 bits.</li>
								<li>This makes <strong>/64 the most used subnet mask</strong> for IPv6 users.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>Interface ID</strong>: Equivalent to the host portion of IPv4. It's called a generic "ID" because IPv6 can have multiple global addresses on multiple interfaces.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>It is strongly recommended never to use an Interface ID smaller than 64 bits.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Global Unicast Address</h2>
						<p>Unlike IPv4, in IPv6 it is possible to assign to hosts:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>All-1s addresses</strong>, because IPv6 has no broadcast address.</li>
							<li><strong>All-0s addresses</strong>, but they are reserved as anycast Subnet-routers address (the routers residing in a subnet).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Configure Static IPv6 Global Address</h2>
					<p>Static configuration on <strong>Cisco routers</strong> is almost identical to IPv4, except the command is <code>ipv6 {address/prefix}</code>.</p>
					<pre><code class="bash">R1(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:1::1/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
R1(config-if)# exit</code></pre>
					<p><strong>On a host</strong> the configuration is identical to IPv4, except it uses IPv6 addresses and prefixes. Optionally, the <strong>default gateway can be configured with its link-local address</strong>.</p>
					<p>For automatic configuration of IPv6 addresses, there are two different ways: <strong>SLAAC and DHCPv6</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration</h2>
						<p>Hosts using <strong>SLAAC</strong> rely on special, periodic messages from local IPv6 Routers called <em>ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)</em>.</p>
						<p>Hosts don't have to wait for a RA, but <strong>they can send a <em>Router Solicitation (RS)</em> message</strong> to local router(s).</p>
						<p>RA contains everything hosts need: <strong>prefix, prefix length, default gateway</strong>. But also one of 3 possible responses:</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>SLAAC only</strong> (Option 1, <u>default</u>): <em>Don't count on a DHCPv6 server</em>.</li>
							<li><strong>SLAAC + DHCPv6</strong> (Option 2): <em>Other infos available from a DHCPv6 Server</em>.</li>
							<li><strong>DHCPv6 only</strong> (Option 3): <em>Please rely exclusively on the DHCPv6 Server</em>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>RA messages, and the default gateway information they contain, use the <strong>link-local IPv6 address</strong> of the router.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DHCPv6</h2>
						<p>The DHCP for IPv6 can provide hosts with <strong>a global unicast address, prefix length, default gateway and DNS servers</strong>.</p>
						<p>An host can use <strong>none, some, or all</strong> theses informations, depending on the option specified in RAs:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>With <strong>Option 1</strong>, SLAAC only, a DHCPv6 server is absent.</li>
							<li>With <strong>Option 2</strong>, SLAAC+DHCPv6, DHCPv6 operates in <strong>stateless mode</strong>: it just provides DNS servers and doesn't keep track of allocated IPv6 addresses.</li>
							<li>With <strong>Option 3</strong>, DHCPv6 only, it behaves in the same <strong>stateful mode</strong> DHCPv4 does, keeping track of allocated resources.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Address Generation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>With DHCPv6-only, the server will provide <strong>the entire IPv6 address</strong> to the clients.</li>
							<li>With SLAAC, <strong>the client must generate its own 64-bit interface ID</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>With the <em>Extended Unique Identifier</em> process, an host can calculate the <em>Interface ID</em> <strong>based on its own MAC address</strong>.</li>
								<li>An host can also <strong>randomly calculate</strong> the Interface ID. This can mitigate privacy concerns in leaking one's own MAC address.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EUI-64</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/08FYCF9.png" style="width: 850px;">
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Link-Local Addresses Generation</h2>
						<p>The link-local addresses can be <strong>dynamically generated</strong> by appending the Interface ID to the FE80::/64 network prefix.</p>
						<p>Example: <code>fe80:0000:0000:0000:ea11:32ff:fe4e:486b</code>.</p>
						<p>But because a MAC rarely contains many 0s, <strong>the resulting link-local address will be very long</strong> and uncompressable.</p>
						<p>By <strong>statically</strong> providing link-local addresses we can make them way more easier to read. On Cisco routers:</p>
						<pre><code class="bash">Router(config-if)# ipv6 address [link-local-address] link-local </code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Link-Local Addresses Generation</h2>
						<p>Because they must be unique only over the same link, <strong>we can use the same link-local address on all the router interfaces</strong>:</p>
						<pre><code class="bash">Router(config)#interface g0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)#interface g0/1
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)#interface s0/0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
Router(config-if)# exit</code></pre>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Multicast Addresses</h2>
						<p>As with IPv4, <strong>multicast groups are represented by addresses</strong>. There are 2 types of IPv6 multicast addresses:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Assigned</strong> - Reserved multicast addresses for pre-defined group on devices, or devices running a common protocol or known service. 2 common assigned multicasts are:</li>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>FF02::1 <em>All-Nodes Multicast Group</em></strong> - A multicast group that any IPv6-enabled host joins, effectively making it the "broadcast" address of IPv6.</li>
								<li><strong>FF02::2 <em>All-Routers Multicast Group</em></strong> - A group joined by all IPv6 routers on the link/network.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>IPv6 Multicast Addresses</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Solicited Node</strong> - A multicast address created for each IPv6 interface, and consisting of a FF02::1:FF00:0:/104 prefix plus the <strong>least significant 24 bits of the Interface ID</strong> from the unicast address.</li>
							<ul>
								<li><strong><u>Important</u></strong>: the "00" in the FF00 is not part of the prefix.</li>
								<li>They are used for obtaining the L2 addresses of other nodes with the <em>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol</em> (equivalent to IPv4's ARP).</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv6 Routers</h2>
					<p>Being IPv6-enabled is not enough to be considered an IPv6 router. The <strong>basic features of an IPv6 router</strong> are:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Forwarding IPv6 packets</strong> between different networks.</li>
						<li>Ability to configure <strong>static IPv6 routes</strong> or a <strong>dynamic IPv6 routing protocol</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>Sending ICMPv6 Router Advertisement</strong> messages.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><u>IPv6 routing is not enabled by default on Cisco routers</u>: you need to enable it with <code>ipv6 unicast-routing</code>.</p>
					<p>Link-local addresses are assigned to interfaces only after this <u>global config</u> command is executed.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>ICMP v4/v6</h2>
						<p>The <strong>ICMP v4/v6</strong> (<em>Internet Control Protocol Message</em>) protocols are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite and <strong>provide feedback about certain errors involving IPv4/v6 packet processing</strong>.</p>
						<p>Because of the information they provide, ICMP messages are frequently blocked for security.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>ICMP v4/v6</h2>
						<p>These ICMP messages are common between v4 and v6:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Host Confirmation</strong>: an ICMP <em>Echo Request</em> is sent to <u>test if an host in operational</u>. If it is an <em>Echo Reply</em> is sent back.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>ICMP Echo messagges are fundamental to the <code>ping</code> network verification utility.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>Destination or Service Unreachable</strong>: when a <u>gateway can't forward a packet</u>, it notifies the source with a code specifying if the net, host, protocol or port is unreachable.</li>
							<li><strong>Time Exceeded</strong>: Used to notify the packet source that the <u>TTL counter in the header has reached 0</u> and the packet is being dropped.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>ICMP v6</h2>
						<p>ICMPv6 introduced 4 new messages as part of the <strong>Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP)</strong>:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Router Solicitation (RS)</strong> - Sent by hosts to routers to <u>obtain addressing</u> autoconfiguration information.</li>
							<li><strong>Router Advertisement (RA)</strong> - Sent by router to hosts to <u>provide addressing</u> autoconfiguration information.</li>
							<li><strong>Neighbor Solicitation (NS)</strong> -Sent by an host to another host to <u>discover its L2 address</u> or to <u>detect a duplicate address</u>.</li>
							<li><strong>Neighbor Advertisement (NA)</strong> - <u>Sent by an host who received a NS</u> to comunicate its L2 address or that an IPv6 address is already in use.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Ping</h2>
					<p>The <code>ping</code> testing utility uses <strong>ICMP Echo request/reply messages to test connectivity between hosts</strong>. There is a <em>timeout</em> and ping considers replies received within it as successful "pings".</p>
					<p>It reports the success rate and the time it took between request and reply, important <u>measures of network performances</u>.</p>
					<p>A successful ping means correct connectivity, but an unsuccessful one does not necessarily imply connectivity issues:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The target host could be not operational.</li>
						<li>ICMP messages could be blocked for security reasons.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Traceroute</h2>
						<p>While ping just test connectivity between 2 hosts, <code>traceroute</code> (<code>tracert</code> in Windows) <strong>details the path</strong> taken by the packet.</p>
						<p><code>traceroute</code> provides its functions by <strong>exploiting the ICMP time exceeded messages caused by deliberately low TTL values</strong>.</p>
						<p><strong>Each row in its output is the interface of a router (hop)</strong> the packet traversed. An asterisk (*) means a <strong>lost packet</strong>. Times represent the <strong>Round Trip Time (RTT)</strong> between sending the packet and getting the response. </p>
						<p>Traceroutes can help identify <u>where in the path a problem occurs</u>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Traceroute</h2>
