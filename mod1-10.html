						<h2>The OSI L7: Application</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DrBlKz8.gif">
						<p>The <strong>Application Layer</strong> involves the <strong>protocols used by programs</strong> to exchange data, regardless of the underlying network.</p>
						<p>L2 is <em>link-to-link</em>, L3 is <em>end-to-end</em>, L4 is <em>process-to-process</em>. <strong>L7 is <em>application-to-application</em></strong>.</p>
						<p>It is the closest to the user and the one actually <strong>producing the data</strong> content.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>TCP/IP vs ISO/OSI Application Layer</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DrBlKz8.gif">
						<p>The TCP/IP Application Layer functionality is splitted into <strong>3 layers in the ISO/OSI framework</strong>.</p>
						<p>Application Layer protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite includes HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP, DNS, SMTP, DHCP, Telnet, TFTP, etc.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Presentation and Session Layers</h2>
					<h3>Layer 6 - Presentation Layer</h3>
					<p>Its purpose is to <strong>represent data in a common way</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It <strong>encodes data in a compatible format</strong>, understandable by the destination.</li>
						<li>It handles <strong>data compression and decompression</strong>.</li>
						<li>It <strong>encrypts and decrypts</strong> for transmission/reception.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It's about <strong>file formats and standards</strong> (like JPG, PNG, MPEG).</p>
					<h3>Layer 5 - Session Layer</h3>
					<p>L5 protocols <strong>initiate (authenticating and authorizing, if necessary), keep active, terminate or restart dialogues</strong> (<em>sessions</em>) between source and destination applications.</p>
					<p>Examples are: PAP, SCP, RPC, PPTP, L2TP, etc.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Client-Server Model</h2>
					<p>In the client-server model:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the host <strong>requesting the information</strong> is a <strong>client</strong>.</li>
						<li>the host <strong>responding to the request and providing the information</strong> is a <strong>server</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>The client begins the exchange</strong> by requesting data from the server, which responds with stream(s) of data to the client.</p>
					<p>Application layer protocols describe the <strong>format of these exchanges between clients and servers</strong>.</p>
					<p>In addition to the actual data (L6) transfer, these exchanges (L7) may require user authentication and session management (L5).</p>
					<p>Server software is often implemented as a <strong>background service</strong> that waits for requests by the clients.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model</h2>
						<p>In the P2P network model devices are <strong><em>peers</em></strong> to one another: they carry <strong>both roles (client and server) simultaneously</strong>.</p>
						<p>Each peer can assume the role of the <strong>client for a particular request</strong>, while acting as a <strong>server role for another</strong> one.</p>
						<p>In the P2P network model, <strong>P2P Applications</strong> are essential to coordinate the roles of the peers without centralizing accounts, permissions, data.</p>
						<p>They can also operate as an <strong>hybrid</strong>: the actual sharing of the resources (file, peripherals, etc) is P2P-based and decentralized, but the <strong>resource indexes are stored on 1 or more centralized servers</strong>. eMule and early BitTorrent are notable examples. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Common P2P Applications</h2>
						<p>P2P applications often consist of a background service and the User Interface.</p>
						<p>Examples of popular P2P applications include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>eDonkey/eMule (<strong>ed2k</strong>-based)</li>
							<li>Shareaza/LionShare (<strong>gnutella</strong>-based)</li>
							<li>BitTorrent/ÂµTorrent (<strong>BitTorrent</strong>-based)</li>
							<li>Bitcoin/Litecoin (<strong>blockchain</strong>-based <strong>Digital Currencies</strong>)</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
						<p>Browsers interpret the URL parts, recognize the type of data and organize retrieval with the server using the right protocol.</p>
						<p>Web pages are identified by their <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong>. When we type an URL into our browser, <strong>pages are requested and served by the HTTP Protocol</strong>.</p>
						<p>HTTP is a request/response protocol. It operates exchanging messages and status codes. The 3 most important messages are <strong>GET, POST and PUT</strong>. Releavant status codes include <strong>200 OK, 304 Not Modified, 404 Not Found</strong>.</p>
						<p>HTTP is not a secure protocol and its exhanges are transmitted in plain text, easily interceptable. <strong>HTTPS</strong> combines HTTP with <strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</strong> and <strong>Transport Secure Layer (TLS)</strong> to provide authentication and encryption.</p>

					<h2>How E-Mail Works</h2>
					<p>Email is a <strong>store-and-forward</strong> messaging system.</p>
					<p>Email clients never communicates directly with one another, they <strong>communicate with servers to send and receive email</strong>.</p>
					<p><strong>Mail servers communicate between them</strong> to relay messages from domain to domain (or even in the same domain).</p>
					<p>The protocol used for <strong>sending mail</strong> (both client-to-server and server-to-server) is the SMTP Protocol.</p>
					<p>Clients' MUAs (Mail User Agent) do <strong>mail retrieval</strong> from servers using either POP or IMAP protocols.</p>
					<p>All these mail protocols needs <strong>proper configuration of the server address</strong> in the MUA.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h2>
					<p>SMTP server software runs <strong>TCP port 25</strong> (587 for Secure SMTP).</p>
					<p>The message format used by SMTP <strong>requires at least 2 headers (sender and recipient addresses)</strong> and a message body.</p>
					<p>Other headers exist, but are optional.</p>
					<p>When the SMTP server receives a message, it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>stores it on a local account, if the recipient is local.</li>
						<li>forwards it to another mail server, using SMTP.</li>
						<li>schedules mail for retransmission if the destination server is offline or not reachable. After a certain expiration time, the server replies to the sender with an <strong>undeliverable</strong> notification.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Post Office Protocol</h2>
					<p>Server listen for POP connection by clients on <strong>TCP Port 110</strong>.</p>
					<p>Generally POP servers <strong>delete the messages</strong> after client retrieval, making it <strong>not ideal for centralized backups and account synchronization</strong>.</p>
					<h2>Internet Message Access Protocol</h2>
					<p>IMAP server software runs on <strong>TCP Port 143</strong> (993 for IMAPS).</p>
					<p><strong>Messages are always kept on the server</strong> until manual deletion. Clients make a local copy of their inbox on the server.</p>
					<p>It's not only message content that is synchronized with the server, but also <strong>folder hierarchy and other metadata</strong>.</p>
					<p><strong>Synchronization is 2-way</strong>, so a mailbox server through IMAP is seamlessly usable on different devices at once.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
						<p>DNS was created to solve the problem of having to remember long numeric addresses. It matches <strong><em>domain names</em></strong> to network addresses and performs <em>address resolution</em>.</p>
						<p>The DNS protocol defines:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a <strong>message format</strong> that is used for all kinds of DNS communications (client queries, server responses, error messages, DNS records transfer betweeen servers).</li>
							<li><strong>DNS records</strong> and their purposes.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The most popular DNS server software is the <em>Berkeley Internet Name Domain</em> (<strong>BIND</strong>) daemon.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How DNS works</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Upon receiving a client's query, <strong>the server DNS daemon search in its own DNS records</strong> for a match to that name.</li>
							<li>If there's none, <strong>it contact other DNS servers</strong> until it is able to resolve the name.</li>
							<li>It then sends a <strong>DNS reply to the client</strong> containing the resolved address, but also put the acquired data into a cache for faster responses and less bandwidth consumption.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DNS Hierarchy</h2>
						<p>DNS uses a hierarchical system to <strong>build the name-to-address mapping database</strong>. It looks like a reverted tree.</p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MafkxjC.gif">
						<p>The database is splitted into small, manageable <strong>DNS zones</strong>. If a server has records corresponding to a certain level in the hierarchy, it is said to be <strong>authoritative</strong> for those records.</p>
						<p>The hierarchy is made by <strong>Root Servers, TLDs</strong> (Top-Level Domain), secondary and so on.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DNS Records</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>A</strong> - Single host address.</li>
							<li><strong>NS</strong> - Authoritative name server.</li>
							<li><strong>CNAME</strong> - It maps a single network address to multiple names that act as an <strong>alias</strong>. It called <em>canonical name</em> or <em>Fully Qualified Domain Name</em>.</li>
							<li><strong>MX</strong> - Used to list the mail servers associated and responsible for exchanging mail for that domain.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yq2gExU.jpg">
						<p>DHCP allows hosts to <strong>autoconfigure network parameters</strong> such IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS servers.</p>
						<p>Addresses are <strong>dynamically</strong> <em>leased</em> from and <strong>address pool</strong>. An address no longer used is returned to the pool for reallocation.</p>
						<p>A DHCP server keeps track of leased addresses in the <strong>configured range</strong>, assuring their uniqueness.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DHCP Operations</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Client broadcasts a <strong>DHCP discover (<em>DHCPDISCOVER</em>)</strong> that will reach any available DHCP server.</li>
							<li>Server replies with a <strong>DHCP offer (<em>DHCPOFFER</em>)</strong>, proposing a lease and providing all network parameters and lease duration.</li>
							<li>Client sends a <strong>DHCP request (<em>DHCPREQUEST</em>)</strong> precisely to the server and lease offer it is accepting.</li>
							<li>Server returns a <strong>DHCP acknowledgment, positive or negative (<em>DHCPACK</em> or <em>DHCPNAK)</em></strong>, finally registering the lease.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Client can also <strong>renew their lease</strong> before expiration, or request a previously assigned address through a DHCPREQUEST.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tmq2tsM.gif">
					<p>FTP is a protocol that allows for <strong>pushing and pulling data</strong> to and from a server. FTP opens 2 connections:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>One on port 21 is just for <strong>connection control</strong>, commands and replies between client and server.</li>
						<li>A second one for the <strong>actual data transfer</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Server Message Block (SMB)</h2>
					<p>SMB (formerly CIFS) is just a client/server sharing protocol that can <strong>share more than just files</strong>, but also printers, serial ports and inter-process messages.</p>
					<p>Unlike FTP, it is made for <strong>long-term connections</strong> that make the resources accessible just as if they were local.</p>
					<p>Since Windows 2000, SMB services use DNS for name resolution, abandoning the previous non-TCP/IP solution (NETBIOS).</p>
					<p>*nix systems have their implementation of the SMB protocol called <strong>SAMBA</strong>.</p>
