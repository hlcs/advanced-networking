				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Introduction</h2>
					<p>EIGRP was released in 1992 by Cisco and until 2013 has only been available on Cisco devices.</p>
					<p>In 2013 Cisco released an informational RFC to IETF covering <strong>basic functionality</strong> of EIGRP, thus making it an open standard able to interoperate with non-Cisco devices. However, advanced functionality of EIGRP remain Cisco-only.</p>
					<p>EIGRP is at the core a <strong>distance-vector routing protocol</strong>, because it learns information about the topology only from directly connected EIGRP routers, but it also borrow features typical of a link-state routing protocol.</p>
					<p>Because of this it has sometimes erroneously been called <strong><em>hybrid</em></strong> routing protocol, but it is a misnomer.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Features</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The algorithm used by EIGRP is the <strong><em>Diffusing Update Algorithm</em> (DUAL)</strong>. One of its characteristics is that it holds every route learned through the protocol, keeping them for backup and avoiding expensive DUAL recomputations.</li>
						<li>EIGRP routers establish <strong>adjancencies</strong>.</li>
						<li>EIGRP use its own packet delivery protocol called <strong><em>Reliable Transport Protocol</em> (RTP)</strong>.</li>
						<li>EIGRP updates and routes do not expire. They are:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Partial</strong>: when a change occurs, only the information about the change is propagated.</li>
							<li><strong>Bounded</strong>: the partial information is sent only to the neighbors that are affected by the change.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>EIGRP is able to maintain and use multiple route to the same destination network and do both <strong>equal and unequal load balancing</strong> of traffic between them.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Protocol-Dependent Modules</h2>
					<p>EIGRP is <strong>network-layer agnostic</strong>. What this means is that it’s able to perform a routing function for really any L3 protocol, even future ones, thanks to <strong><em>protocol-dependent modules</em> (PDMs)</strong>.</p>
					<p>PDMs job is to "translate" the L3 protocol to the DUAL algo and to store the results of DUAL into tables specific to the L3 protocol. It works as an <strong>abstraction layer</strong> for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>maintaining <strong>neighbor and topology tables</strong> specific to the L3 protocol.</li>
						<li>Rx/Tx EIGRP packets encapsulated in the L3 protocol.</li>
						<li>handling the L3 protocol routing table for DUAL.</li>
						<li>computing the metric and handling to DUAL.</li>
						<li>handling ACLs specific to the L3 protocol.</li>
						<li>redistribution of routes learned through other routing protocols into EIGRP and viceversa.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>RTP and Authentication</h2>
					<p>The consequences of being L3-agnostic is that EIGRP cannot use TCP and UDP, which are specific to IPv4/6.</p>
					<p>EIGRP uses its own transport protocol, the <em>Reliable Transport Protocol</em>. It obviously supports <strong>reliable delivery</strong> (requiring ACKs, similar to TCP), but <strong>it also does unrealiable delivery</strong> with no acknowledge requirements.</p>
					<p>RTP supports <strong>both unicast and multicast</strong> for sending EIGRP packets. Multicast addresses for EIGRP are 224.0.0.10 (IPv4) and FF02::A (IPv6).</p>
					<p>EIGRP <strong>supports MD5 authentication</strong> of routing packets as RIP and OSPF, but <strong>doesn’t encrypt them</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Messages</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Hello</strong> - Used to establish and maintain adjacencies with neighbors.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sent with unreliable RTP, as multicast where supported.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Update</strong> - Used to deliver routing information to neighbors.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sent with reliable RTP, unicast or multicast.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Acknowledgment</strong> - Used to conferm the reception of <u>any</u> EIGRP packet that was sent using reliable delivery.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sent with unreliable RTP, as unicast. </li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Query</strong> - Used to ask neighbors for certain routes.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sent with reliable RTP, as unicast or multicast.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Reply</strong> - Response to EIGRP queries.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sent with reliable RTP, as unicast</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>All of these are encapsulated in IPv4 (with the <strong>Protocol</strong> field set to <strong>88</strong>) or IPv6 packets (with the <strong>Next Header</strong> field also <strong>88</strong>).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Hello Packets</h2>
					<p>Used to discover EIGRP neighbors and establish and maintain adjacencies with them. They are sent with unreliable RTP (so no ACK expected).</p>
					<p>They are sent as multicast and <strong>every 5 seconds on broadcast-enabled networks</strong>, and <strong>every 60 seconds on NBMA networks</strong> (X.25, Frame Relay, T1).</p>
					<p>An established adjacencies is considered broken when no Hello packet has been received for an <strong>Hold timer</strong>. The hold timer value is 3x the Hello timer (5s on broadcast, 180s on NBMA).</p>
					<p><strong>After that, the routes through that neighbor are no longer viable</strong> to EIGRP, that starts to search for a new path by sending query packets.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Update and Acknowledgement Packets</h2>
					<p>EIGRP <strong>routing informations</strong> are propagated through its Update packets.</p>
					<p>They are not periodic, but instead only sent incrementally (<strong>partial</strong>) and only to the affected EIGRP-neighbors (<strong>bounded</strong>). The net effect is a huge bandwidth saving achievable with EIGRP.</p>
					<p>When required by a single router, they are sent as unicast, otherwise as multicast (on supported networks). In any case they use reliable delivery so <strong>acknowledge is required</strong>.</p>
					<p>EIGRP Acknowledge packets have the form of an <strong>Hello packet without any data</strong>. They are obviously sent with <strong>unreliable RTP</strong>, otherwise they would cause a loop of ACKs.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Query and Reply</h2>
					<p>Queries and Replies are used by EIGRP and DUAL when <strong>searching information</strong> in other neighbors.</p>
					<p>Both use <strong>reliable delivery</strong>, so this means that both of them have to be acknowledged. Queries are sent as multicast, while Replies as unicast.</p>
					<p>Replies have to be <strong>sent even for negative answers</strong>, that is when a neighbor doesn’t have the required information.</p>
					<p>An EIGRP router send queries even for a network previously attached to it that it is now down, because there’s always the possibility of another path in the topology.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP Packet Format</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/072dOCQ.gif">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP Header</h2>
						<p>EIGRP data field is called <strong>TLV (<em>Type, Length and Value</em>)</strong>. There are many, but CCNA focuses on 3 of them. Regardless of the TLV, <strong>the same EIGRP packet header is used</strong>.</p>
						<p>The important field in the EIGRP header are the <strong>OpCode</strong> and the <strong>Autonomous System Number</strong>.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>OpCode specifies the packet type</strong>, by using 1 for Update, 3 for Query, 4 for Reply and 5 for Hello. Acknowledgments are Hello packets with no data.</li>
							<li>The <strong>Autonomous System Number identifies the routing process</strong>, similar to OSPF Process ID.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP TLV - Parameter</h2>
						<p>The <strong>EIGRP Parameter’s TLV</strong> (also known as General TLV, Type 0x0001) includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>K1, K2, K3, K4, K5</strong> fields. Through them EIGRP knows which parameters to use as <strong><em>weights</em> to compute the composite metric</strong>.</li>
							<li>The <strong>Hold timer</strong> is the time the neighor should wait <strong>before considering the adjancency broken</strong> and the sending router down.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP TLV - IP Internal</h2>
						<p>The <strong>IP Internal Route TLV</strong> (Type 0x0002) is a message used to <strong>advertise EIGRP routes</strong> in the autonomous system. It includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> - The <strong>lowest</strong> configured bandwidth of an interface along that route.</li>
							<li><strong>Delay</strong> - Measured in units of 10 microseconds, the <strong>sum of the delays</strong> of the interfaces along that route.</li>
							<li><strong>Prefix Length</strong> - The subnet mask, measured in number of network bits.</li>
							<li><strong>Destination</strong> - The address of the destination network. It only contains the network portion (172.17.0.0/16 = 172.17). The minimum length is 24 bits, so if necessary padding is added. If prefix length is more than 24, the field is extended another 32 bits.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP TLV - IP External</h2>
						<p>The <strong>IP External Route TLV</strong> (Type 0x0003) is a message for <strong>importing external routes into EIGRP</strong>, such as a default static route.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The first part of this TLV has <strong>fields used to track the external route</strong>.</li>
							<li>The second part has the <strong>same fields used for IP Internal TLVs</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Autonomous System Numbers</h2>
					<p><strong>EIGRP’s autonomous system numbers are unrelated to the AS numbers assigned by IANA.</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>IANA’s Autonomous Systems are assigned (originally 16 bits, 0-65535, now 32 bits) to large collection of networks that are administered by a single entity.</li>
						<li>Inside an AS, IGP routing protocols are used by that entity according to its own preferences, policies, network design.</li>
						<li>The AS then interfaces with other ASes, presenting a single consistent Internet routing policy to them using BGP (the only routing protocol that use IANA’s AS numbers).</li>
						<li><strong>EIGRP AS numbers works as process IDs to distinguish different EIGRP istances</strong> that might be running on the routers in a network. In some case it can be advisable to use independent EIGRP instances to handle different networks.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>IPv4 EIGRP Configuration</h2>
					<p>To enter EIGRP configuration mode, use</p>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# router eigrp [autonomous_system]</code></pre>
					<p>The AS number ranges between 1-65535. <strong>It has to be the same within the desidered EIGRP routing domain</strong>.</p>
					<p>This command <strong>doesn’t start the EIGRP process</strong>, but only enters the configuration mode. The “no” version of this command stops the process and delete all existing config.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Router ID</h2>
					<p>Everything is <strong>the same as with OSPF</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Expressed as 32 bit IPv4 addresses</strong>, but it is not an actual IP.</li>
						<li>First, manually configured Router IDs with
							<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# eigrp router-id [id]</code></pre>
						</li>
						<li>Second, highest IP on any loopback interface.</li>
						<li>Third, highest IP on any active actual interface, EIGRP-enabled or not.</li>
						<li>Displayed with <code>show ip protocols</code> command.</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight" style="max-height: 200px;">Router(config-router)# eigrp router-id 1.2.3.4

					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP Network Announcements</h2>
						<p>The <strong><code>network</code></strong> command works just as in any IGP routing protocol and has the same effects:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Any interface which has an address in that network gets EIGRP-enabled and start sending and processing EIGRP updates.</li>
							<li>That network is announced in EIGRP routing updates.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>There are 2 versions of the network command:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><code>network {classful_address}</code> enables interfaces and announces subnets of that classful address.</li>
							<li><code>network {network_address} [wildcard]</code> enables a specific subnet and the interface belonging in that subnet.</li>
							<li>In some IOS version the subnet mask can also be used, but it will be converted to the wildcard in the config.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Passive Interfaces</h2>
						<p>EIGRP also allows for <strong>passive interfaces</strong>, when we want to announce a subnet but sending routing updates would be useless (because there are no neighbors) or undesirable (because the other end of the link is not under our control).</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# passive-interface [if_id]</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# passive-interface default

					<h2>EIGRP AD and Summarization</h2>
					<p>EIGRP is the <strong>preferred IGP routing protocol</strong> on Cisco devices. Its routes have an <strong>AD of 90</strong> for internal routes and 170 for external ones (imported from non-EIGRP sources).</p>
					<p>There is also an AD of 5 for EIGRP summary route. However, <strong>EIGRP autosummarization is disabled by default since IOS 15.0</strong>. On previous IOS version, it can be disabled with</p>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# no auto-summary</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Adjacencies</h2>
					<p>For 2 EIGRP-enabled routers to establish an adjancency, <strong>several parameters must match</strong>. Among them there are <strong>metric weights</strong> and <strong>AS number</strong>.</p>
					<p>The <strong>exchange of Hello packets</strong> to establish adjacency goes as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>R1 sends an Hello packet on all of its EIGRP-enabled interfaces.</li>
						<li>R2 receive the Hello packet and sends an Update packet with its routing information, except for routes learned through that interface (this technique is called <em>split horizon</em>).</li>
						<li>However at this stage R1 and R2 are stil not neighbour. <strong>Only when R2 sends an Hello packet and R1 receives it the adjancency is established</strong> and neighbor tables updated.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>EIGRP Topology Table</h2>
					<p>The content of EIGRP Update packets received from neighbors is included in routers’ <strong>topology table</strong>. There’s one topology table for every routable protocol.</p>
					<p>It is different from the routing table because <strong>it contains every route to every destination network learned by EIGRP</strong>, even the ones that won’t be installed in the routing table.</p>
					<p>The <strong>exchange of routing information</strong> goes as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>R1 receives the Update packet from R2 and updates the topology table with destinations and respective metrics.</li>
						<li>R1 sends an Acknowledgment packet to R2, because Update uses reliable delivery.</li>
						<li>R1 sends an Update packet to R2 with its complete routing information except those learned from R2.</li>
						<li>R2 acknoledges the Update packet received from R1.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>EIGRP Composite Metric</h2>
						<p>EIGRP uses a <strong>composite metric</strong>: this means the cost of a path is the <strong>result of a formula</strong> that uses several combined parameters (<strong><em>weights</em></strong>).</p>
						<p>For the composite metric to make sense, <strong>every EIGRP routers in the routing domain have to agree on the same weights</strong> to compute it. They do so with the K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5 parameters in the General TLV.</p>
						<p>The <strong>general EIGRP composite metric formula</strong> is:</p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vArSqGv.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Parameters and Weights</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vArSqGv.png">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> - The slowest bandwidth of any exit interface along the routing path. The value is used scaled (10000000 / actual bandwidth). <u>Weighted by default</u> (<strong>K1</strong> = 1).</li>
							<li><strong>Load</strong> - The worst load on any link on the routing path, computed as exponential average over 5 minutes between bandwidth and packet rate of the interfaces. Ranges from 0 to 255 (255 is 100% load). <u>Not weighted by default</u> (<strong>K2</strong> = 0).</li>
							<li><strong>Delay</strong> - The sum of all exiting interfaces’ delay along the routing path. Measured in 10s of microseconds (it takes a packet to travel that route). <u>Weighted by default</u> (<strong>K3</strong> = 0).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Parameters and Weights</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vArSqGv.png">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - The likelihood a packet will successfully be transmitted on a link on the routing path, based on previous keepalives, computed as exponential average over 5 minutes. Measured in the range of 0 (completely unreliable) to 255 (perfect reliability). <u>Not weighted by default</u> (<strong>K4</strong> = 0, <strong>K5</strong> = 0).</li>
							<li><strong>MTU</strong>, while included in routing updates, is <strong>not a metric weight</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>With the default weights, the general formula simply becomes</p>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GCCffGo.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Altering the Weights</h2>
						<p>The K parameters can be altered with the command</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# metric weights {tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5}</code></pre>
						<p>and verified with <code>show ip protocols</code>. Nevertheless, modifying them is not advisable because <strong>normally not weighted parameters will result in frequent recalculation of the metric</strong>, and hence the topology table.</p>
						<p>All of the metric parameters can be displayed in the output of:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# show interfaces Fa0/1
FastEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up
[output omitted]
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 10000 Kbit, DLY 100000 usec, rely 255/255, load 1/255
[output omitted]</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bandwidth and Load</h2>
						<p><strong>Bandwidth and load are not measured dynamically</strong>, and are instead fixed values that can be tuned.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Bandwidth is altered with the <code>bandwidth [kbps_value]</code> interface command. This is especially important for serial links, because a speed of T1 (1544 Kbps) is often the default.</li>
							<li>Default <strong>Delay values depend on the type of link</strong> (eg: 1000 for FastEthernet, 20000 for Serial links)</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>DUAL Overview</h2>
					<p>EIGRP uses <strong>both split horizon and hold-down timers</strong> (an interval after a network goes down in which the router will refuse routes to that network, to avoid potential instability) <strong>to avoid routing loops</strong>.</p>
					<p>The main loop-avoiding mechanism in EIGRP is <strong>DUAL</strong>. When there is a topology change, DUAL make sure that <strong>affected router re-synchronize at the same time</strong> while excluding unaffected routers from the topology recomputation.</p>
					<p>DUAL makes its decision about route recomputations with a <strong>workflow model</strong> known as <strong><em>DUAL Finite State Machine</em> (FSM)</strong>, which is made up of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A certain, finite, number of stages (<em>states</em>)</li>
						<li>Transition between states.</li>
						<li>Operations</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>DUAL: Successor and Feasible Distance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Successor</strong> - A neighboring router that is the next hop for a certain destination network. Its IP is shown in the routing table after the "<strong>via</strong>" keyword.</li>
						<li><strong>Feasible Distance (FD)</strong> - It’s the lowest metric available for a route to a certain destination network. It’s the second number in the square brackets in an EIGRP routing table entry.</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# show ip route

D 10.18.12.0/24  [90/3012096] via 172.17.87.3, 02:11:10, Serial0/0/0</code></pre>
					<p>DUAL is why EIGRP routes are marked as <strong>"D" in the routing table</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>DUAL: Feasibility Condition</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>DUAL stores every learned route</strong>, to use them as backup paths and quickly achieve convergence with no need for recomputation, after a topology change.</li>
						<li>A <strong>Feasible Successor (FS)</strong> is a backup route to a certain destination network that satisfies a certain condition known as <strong>Feasibility Condition (FC)</strong>. If the FC is met, the backup route is <strong>guaranteed to be loop-free</strong> and so can be a FS.</li>
						<li>The <strong>Reported Distance (RD)</strong> to a destination network is simply the FD that a neighbor of a local router says it has to the same destination network. The <strong><u>FC is satisfied if the neighbour’s RD is less than the local router’s FD</u></strong>.</li>
						<li>Why? If the RD is less than the FD, then <strong>it’s impossible that the local router is part of the path</strong> that the neighbor is advertising, which is the definition of a loop.</li>
					</ul>

							<li>The <strong>destination network</strong> and the number of alternative paths to it (before the “successors” keyword).</li>

						<h2>EIGRP Non-Feasible Successors</h2>
						<p>It could happen that <strong>a backup route it’s actually available, but that it doesn’t meet the FC</strong>.</p>
						<p>If so, that backup route <strong>doesn’t enter the topology table</strong>. To display every link regardless of the FC requirements, the command <strong><code>show ip eigrp topology all-links</code></strong> is available.</p>
						<p>Being a distance-vector routing protocol, <strong>EIGRP doesn’t build a map of the network topology</strong>. DUAL only way to guarantee no routing loop is to respect the FC. <strong>A non-FS route can still be used</strong>, but further processing by DUAL is required and a delay is inevitable.</p>

						<h2>DUAL FSM</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WO8lCHq.png">
						<p>DUAL route calculation engine is known as <strong><em>Finite State Machine</em></strong>, which is an abstract model used to descrive how a router react to input events to make decisions about routes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DUAL FSM</h2>
						<p>FSM study is not part of CCNA. To understand how DUAL is operating, however, the output of the FSM can be enabled with the command <strong><code>debug eigrp fsm</code></strong>.</p>
						<p>When DUAL cannot find a FS meeting the FC, it <strong>puts the route into active state</strong>. The router <strong>queries its neighbors</strong> for a route to that destination network and waits for replies. If the replies contain a route to that network, it can become a new successor.</p>

					<h2>IPv4 vs IPv6 EIGRP</h2>
					<p>IPv6 EIGRP has been available since IOS 12.4(6)T, by <strong>adding the IPv6 PDM</strong>. It runs <strong>independently from IPv4 EIGRP</strong>.</p>
					<p>The <strong>differences are minimal</strong>. DUAL and FSM, RTP, EIGRP packet types, the composite metric are common traits.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>EIGRP-IPv6 still uses IPv4-like router IDs</strong>. So on an IPv6-only network it’s important to manually set the router ID.</li>
						<li><strong>EIGRP-IPv6 messages are sourced from IPv6 link-local addresses</strong>. Multicast address is FF02::A.</li>
						<li><strong>EIGRP-IPv6 config mode</strong> is entered with</li>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config)# ipv6 router eigrp {as_number}</code></pre>
						<li>As with many IPv6 routing protocols, it’s <strong>enabled directly on the interface</strong> config:</li>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-if)# ipv6 eigrp {as_number}</code></pre>
					</ul>

					<h2>Troubleshooting EIGRP</h2>
					<p>EIGRP simply cannot operate correctly <strong>if the right adjacencies are not formed</strong>. By default, every adjacency change is displayed in the terminal thanks to the command</p>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# eigrp log-neighbor-changes
%DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: EIGRP-IPv6 2: Neighbor FE80::1
(Serial0/0/0) is up: new adjacency</code></pre>
					<p>If an adjacency isn’t formed like it’s supposed of, <strong>first verify network connectivity to that neighbor</strong>, which is a prerequisite.</p>
					<p>If the ping is successful but the adjacency isn’t formed, <strong>check that both routers are using the same AS number</strong> and that <strong>the network the neighbor belongs to is included in <code>network</code> statements</strong>.</p>
					<p>For EIGRP-IPv6, <strong>manually set the link-local addresses</strong> to more easily identify the interfaces in debug/config (eg. FE80::2 for R2).</p>
