					<h1>OSPF Theory</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSPF Timeline</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>OSPF development was started in a <strong>IETF working group</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>OSPFv1</strong> was released in 1989 with RFC 1131 as an experimental routing protocol with a double implementation: one for router and one for UNIX. It was never actually deployed.</li>
						<li><strong>OSPFv2</strong> was released in 1991 with RFC 1247. It was the recommended IGP protocol by the IETF.</li>
						<li>OSPFv2 has been <strong>updated</strong> in RFC 2328, the <strong>current OSPF standard</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>OSFPv3</strong> was first published in 19998 (RFC 2740) and then updated in 2008 (RFC 5340). It's not only IPv6-enabled, but also a major change in the specifications.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSPF Features</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Has all the typical operations and advantages of a <strong>link-state</strong> routing protocol.</li>
						<li><strong>Classless</strong>, supporting VLSM and CIDR.</li>
						<li>Has <strong>low convergence</strong> times.</li>
						<li>It <strong>supports multi-area design</strong>, with much <strong>better scalability</strong>.</li>
						<li>It’s <strong>authenticated</strong>: routers encrypt OSPF updates using the MD5 algorithm and a pre-shared password.</li>
						<li>It has AD of 110.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSPF Components and Messages</h2>
					<p>OSPF has three main data structures in its internals:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Adjacency Database/Neighbor Table</strong> - A list of all router’s neighbour, which is of course unique for each router.</li>
						<li><strong>Link-state database (LSDB)/Topology Table</strong> - A list of all the information about link-states for the other routers in the networks, received through flooding. Identical for all the OSPF routers, because it represents the current topology.</li>
						<li><strong>Forwarding Database/Routing Table</strong> - The list of routes that are learned by the protocol and added to the routing table.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>OSPF uses <strong>several types of packets to convey different messages</strong>: Hello packets, database description packets, link-state request, update and acknowledgment packets.</p>
					<p>OSPF <strong>uses Djkstra SPF’s algorithm</strong> with a metric based on cumulative bandwidth.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSPF Operations</h2>
					<p>OSPF has all the main typical operations of a link-state routing protocol, plus a few peculiarities and implementation details.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Learning <strong>directly connected routes</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>Discovering the neighbors</strong>, forming <em>adjancencies</em> through the sending and receiving of the Hello messages.</li>
						<li><strong>Producing link-state advertisement</strong> that lists all of the router’s adjacencies.</li>
						<li><strong>Flooding the LSAs</strong> to all the other routers.</li>
						<li><strong>Building the LSDB</strong>, by collecting every LSAs received through flooding.</li>
						<li><strong>Building the graph representing the network topology</strong>, by reading all the adjacencies in the LSDB.</li>
						<li><strong>Running SPF</strong> to calculate the shortest path.</li>
						<li><strong>Updating the routing table</strong> with the new best paths.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Single- and Multi-Area</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0xhsWRt.png">
						<p>OSPF achieves better scalability than other routing protocols by <strong>supporting the split of all the AS’ routers into multiple areas</strong>, although it can also run in <strong>single-area mode</strong> (called <strong><em>backbone area</em></strong> or <strong><em>area 0</em></strong>).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Single- and Multi-Area</h2>
						<p><strong>An "area" is a subset of the OSPF routers that share the same LSBD</strong>, because LSAs reach only the router in the area and not those outside. When running in multiarea mode:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Areas have a hierarchy</strong>, because every area must connect to the backbone area.</li>
							<li>The routers in between areas are called <strong>Area Border Routers (ABRs)</strong>. They deal with inter-area routing, which is a little different from intra-area routing because <strong>it does not involve typical LSAs and SPF recalculations</strong>.</li>
							<li>The routing table are smaller, due to summarization of another area’s routes.</li>
							<li><strong>Link-state expensive operations</strong>, like SPF computations and graph constructions, have less of an impact because they <strong>operate on a reduced topology</strong>.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>OSPF Encapsulation</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KK14G6p.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Encapsulation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>L2 Header</strong> - Because OSPF flooding is multicast-based, destination multicast MAC addresses are used: 01:00:5E:00:00:05/06.</li>
							<li><strong>L3 Header</strong> - OSPF has a reserved value of 89 in the IP Protocol field, and it uses two multicast addresses: 224.0.0.5/6.</li>
							<li><strong>OSPF Header</strong> - It contains which particular OSPF packet type this frame contains, and IDs for the router which sent it and the area it belongs to.</li>
							<li><strong>OSPF Packet Data</strong> - The actual content of the specific OSPF packet, which depends on its type.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Packet Types</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>0x01 Hello</strong> - Discovering an maintaining adjancencies.</li>
							<li><strong>0x02 Database Description (DBD)</strong> - Contains a short summary of the router’s LSDB. Other routers use this datas to check if their LSDBs are synchronized.</li>
							<li><strong>0x03 Link-State Request (LSR)</strong> - If LSDBs are not synchronized, a router can request information about the specific link-states needed.</li>
							<li><strong>0x04 Link-State Update (LSU)</strong> - Reply to a LSR.</li>
							<li><strong>0x05 Link-State Acknowledgment (LSAck)</strong> - Sent to confirm that a LSU has been received.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Common Header</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/m8hZ4IF.gif">
						<small>The OSPF header is <strong>the same for all OSPF packet types</strong>.</small>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Type</strong> - Identifies the precise type of OSFP packet.</li>
							<li><strong>Router ID</strong> - Expressed like an IPv4 decimal dotted address, it is unique to the router that originated the packet.</li>
							<li><strong>Area ID</strong> - Area to which the originating router belongs.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Hello Packet</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CEWBWnD.png">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Network Mask</strong> - Subnet mask of the originating interface.</li>
							<li><strong>Hello Interval</strong> - Frequency of sent Hello packets, that <u>must be the same on neighbour router</u>. By <strong>default it is 10s on multi-access and PtP</strong> networks, and <strong>30s on non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA)</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF Hello Packet</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Router Priority</strong> - A value that's <strong>used to elect</strong> 2 special routers, <strong>the DR</strong> (<em>Designated Router</em>) <strong>and the BDR</strong> (<em>Backup Designated Router</em>). It has range 0-255 and 1 as a default. The higher the value, the higher the chance the router is elected DR.</li>
							<li><strong>Dead Interval</strong> - the timeout <strong>after which a router</strong> who has not received Hello packets from a neighbour <strong>considers that adjacency broken</strong>. It <u>must be equally set between neighbor routers</u>, and <strong>by default has 4x the value of the Hello Interval</strong>.</li>
							<li><strong>DR</strong> and <strong>BDR</strong> are the IDs of the designated and backup designated routers.</li>
							<li><strong>Neighbours</strong> - A list of all the router IDs the originating router has an adjacency with.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OSPF Link-State Updates</h2>
					<p>What we generally called <strong>LSAs</strong> (<em>link-state advertisements</em>) when overviewing a link-state protocol operations, <strong>are split into several stages and packets in OSPF</strong>.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Initially</strong> the link-state informations are flooded from the originating router in <strong>a short form, the DBD</strong>.</li>
						<li>After a router has checked incoming DBDs and detected <strong>available new informations, it sends a LSR</strong> to request them.</li>
						<li>The originating router includes <strong>one or more LSAs into a link-state update (LSU)</strong>. There are <strong>11 different types of LSAs</strong> in OSPFv2. Because LSUs contains LSAs, they can almost always be considered synonyms.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF States</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/w2NuFat.png" width="75%" height="75%">
						<p><strong>From boot to convergence</strong>, OSPF goes through several stages.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF States: Adjacencies</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Initially, <strong>no Hello packets have been received</strong> by two neighbor router (R1 and R2) and are therefore <strong>both in a <u>Down</u> state</strong>.</li>
							<li>R1/R2 <strong>sends/receives a first Hello</strong> packet, and both <strong>transition to the <u>Init</u></strong> state.</li>
							<li>R2 sends an Hello packet to R1. Now <strong>R1 sees itself included as a neighbour</strong> in another router’s Hello packet, and <strong>transition to the <u>Two-Way</u></strong> state. R2 will follow on the next received Hello and from now on <strong>Hello packet will be continuously exhanged</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>If the two neighbour are <strong>connected with a PtP link</strong>, they transition right away to the <strong>next phase</strong>.</li>
								<li>If the routers are <strong>connected over an Ethernet network</strong>, the <strong>election of a DR and DBR</strong> must take place.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OSPF States: Synchronization</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Now that adjancencies and roles are established, neighbors starts synchronizing their LSDBs transitioning to <strong>the <u>ExStart</u> state, in which they negotiate a master/slave relationship and a DBDs starting sequence number</strong>, after which the master starts sending its DBDs.</li>
							<li>When other <strong>neighbor routers starts sending DBDs, they all reach the <u>Exchange</u> state</strong>. If by analyzing the DBDs the routers conclude their <strong>LSDBs are not aligned, they transition to the <u>Loading</u> state</strong>, otherwise to the <u>Full</u> state.</li>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>In the <u>Loading</u> state routers use LSRs and LSUs</strong> to obtain new available information to synchronize their LSDBs, recalculate the graph and best paths.</li>
								<li>When they are done, or LSDBs were already synchronized, they reached <strong>convergence, also known as <u>Full</u> state</strong>.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<h2>Designated Router</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kDYBUPw.png">
						<p>On a multi-access and broadcast-capable medium like Ethernet, this topology would generate <strong><em>n(n-1)/2</em></strong> = 10 adjancencies. It would exponentially grow if we add more routers.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Designated Router</h2>
						<p>In this situation <strong>flooding to every adjacency</strong> like OSPF does <strong>would become excessive</strong>.</p>
						<p>The OSPF solution to this problem is to elect a <strong><em>Designated Router</em> (DR)</strong> that will have the task to <strong>collect and distribute all the LSAs</strong>.</p>
						<p>A <em>Backup designated Router</em> (BDR) is also elected to provide redundancy.</p>
						<p>All the other adjacent routers become <strong><em>DROTHERS</em></strong>.</p>
						<p>If the medium in use is <strong>not broadcast-based</strong>, like Frame Relay, <strong>DR and BDR are not necessary</strong> even in similar topologies.</p>

					<section>
						<h2>Router ID</h2>
						<p>OSPF needs every router to have its own router ID, for:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Unique Identification</strong> - Every other router in the domain will know certain packets originated from this router.</li>
							<li><strong>DR Election</strong> - If configured priority doesn't elect a DR, the role will be filled by the router with the higher router ID.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Router ID can be <strong>manually configured</strong> with:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# router-id [a.b.c.d]
Router(config-router)# end
Router# show ip protocols
*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***

Routing Protocol is "ospf 10"
[...]
  Router ID [a.b.c.d]
[...]</code></pre>
						<p>Even if it has the appearances of an IPv4 address, the Router ID is <strong>not an actual assigned and routable address</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Router ID Selection</h2>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nnqPLoA.jpg">
						<p><strong>Even non-OSPF interfaces</strong> participate in determining the Router ID!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Router ID Reset</h2>
						<p>Given that a router is listed as neighbor in other router's databases through its Router ID, <strong>changing it requires to renegotiate all the adjancencies</strong>.</p>
						<p>After changing the Router ID, the command</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# clear ip ospf process
Reset ALL OSPF processes? [no]: y
Router# 
*Mar 25 19:46:22.423: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 10, Nbr 3.3.3.3

						<p>must be issued, forcing <strong>a restart from the Down and Init states</strong>.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Enabling Interfaces</h2>
					<p>Just as we saw for RIP, we use the <code>network</code> command to enable OSPF on a specific interface, but the parameters are different:</p>
					<pre><code class="no-highlight">network [network_address] [wildcard_mask] area [area_id]</code></pre>
					<p>The <strong>Area ID must be the same for all the router belonging to the Single-Area</strong> we are configuring. It is advisable to <strong>use the value of 0</strong>.</p>
					<p>The <strong><em>Wildcard mask</em></strong> is a 32 bits "address" which is <strong>exactly the reverse of the subnet mask</strong>: the 1s of the subnet mask becomes 0s and viceversa.</p>
					<pre>IP Address     172.16.240.0
Subnet Mask    255.255.240.0
Wildcard Mask  0.0.15.255</pre>
					<p>The fastest way to calculate the wildcard mask is to <strong>subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255</strong>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
					<h2>OSPF Metric</h2>
						<p>Cisco's implementation of OSPF uses <strong>bandwidth</strong> (translated into a <strong>cost</strong>), as the metric. A link with a <strong>higher bandwidth will result in a lower cost</strong>, and therefore a better metric.</p>
						<p>The cost of a route will be the <strong>accumulated cost of all the links in the path</strong>.</p>
						<p>The equation used to calculate the cost of an OSPF link is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Cost = (Int) Reference Bandwidth / Link Bandwidth</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6CrFItf.jpg">
						<p>The <strong>default reference bandwidth is 100 Mb/s</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Adjusting OSPF Costs</h2>
						<p><strong>Links with a bandwidth equal or higher to the reference bandwidth will result in the same OSPF cost</strong>.</p>
						<p>To achieve better accuracy for the metric on faster interfaces, we can adjust the reference bandwidth with the command:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-router)# auto-cost reference-bandwidth [value_in_mbps]</code></pre>
						<p>This new reference has to be equal on all routers, otherwise we would have <strong>inconsistent cumulative costs for routes</strong>.</p>
						<p>We can also <strong>adjust the interface bandwidth</strong> (only <u>the nominal value, not the actual throughput</u>!) with the command:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-ig)# bandwidth [new_value_in_kbps]</code></pre>
						<p>We can also just <strong>set a manual cost</strong> for the interface:</p>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router(config-ig)# no bandwidth [new_value_in_kbps]
Router(config-ig)# ip ospf cost [new_cost]</code></pre>
					</section>

						<h2>Troubleshooting OSPFv2</h2>
						<h3>Verifying Neighbors</h3>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Router# show ip ospf neighbor

					<h2>OSPFv2 vs. OSPFv3</h2>
					<p>OSPFv2 and v3 have a lot in common, but the main difference is obviously that they <strong>operate on top of a different IP version</strong>.</p>
					<p>In dual-stack networks, <strong>their processes run completely independently</strong>, each with its own data strucures, settings and algorithms. The main differences to consider are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Link-local addresses as source</strong> of the OSPFv3 packets.</li>
						<li><strong>IPv6 multicast</strong> destination addresses: FF02::5 (<em>All-OSPF-router</em>) and FF02::6 (<em>DR/DBR</em>).</li>
						<li>Networks are enabled in the interface configuration:</li>
						<pre><code class="no-highlight">Route(config-if)# ipv6 ospf [process_id] area [area_id]</code></pre>
						<li>OSPFv3 uses the <strong>IPv6 embedded authentication</strong>.</li>
						<li>OSPFv3 uses the same Router IDs and selection process based on IPv4 addresses. <u>No Manual ID + No IPv4 = Error</u>.</li>
					</ul>
