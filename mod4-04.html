						<h2>Leased Line Disadvantages</h2>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Leased Line Disadvantages</h2>
						<ul>
						<li>Fixed capacity, any <strong>unused capacity is still paid</strong> for entirely. No incremental bandwidth. Charged based on max bandwidth, not actual.</li>
						<li>Service Providers <strong>cannot use the leased infrastructure for anything else</strong>, so they charge you accordingly for the priviledge.</li>
						<li>Each endpoint needs <strong>many access circuits</strong> to create the desired topology, so many router interfaces and CSU/DSUs.</li>
						<li>Leased lines are <strong>difficult to install and setup</strong>.</li>
						<li>Zero flexibility.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

						<h2>Frame Relay</h2>
						<p>Frame Relay (FR) is a WAN protocol, derived fron X.25 and operating at L1 and L2, that solves these problems:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>For <strong>subscribers of WAN services</strong>, it allows to obtain much of the benefits (and more flexibility) of a leased line at a <strong>fraction of the cost</strong>.</li>
							<li>For <strong>Service Providers</strong>, it allows to leverage a <strong>single infrastructure</strong> (little need to physically change it) <strong>at its maximum potential</strong>, maximizing returns.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>How? With Frame Relay.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The subscriber only has to <strong>pay for the local loop</strong> (leased line) for each site, connecting them <strong>to the FR network</strong> of the provider. End-user <strong>configuration is minimal</strong>.</li>
							<li>The provider creates the topology desired by the subscriber over its "<em>frame relay cloud</em>" of interconnected FR switches that is <strong>completely transparent to the users</strong>: they are effectively sharing it, but it appears as dedicated leased lines.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Nowadays, FR is being <strong>supplanted by MPLS and MetroEthernet</strong>, but it’s still relied on in some locations using legacy connectivy solutions.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Frame Relay "Cloud"</h2>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/djJMzW9.png" style="width: 450px;">
					<p>Sites connect to the FR network with <strong>short dedicated lines</strong> between the local router (DTE) and the <strong>FR switch</strong> (DCE).</p>
					<p>The network <strong>topology is then configured <u>by the SP</u></strong> over the frame relay cloud using logical paths known as <em>virtual circuits</em>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Virtual Circuit</h2>
						<p>A <strong><em>virtual circuit</em></strong> (VC) is a <u>connection made through the FR network between two DTEs</u>. To the DTEs, is <strong>equivalent to a leased line between them</strong>.</p>
						<p>It is virtual because the <strong>path is configured logically</strong> in the FR switches, there isn’t a direct electical connection. This means it <strong>can be shared</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Virtual Circuit</h2>
						<p>VC are of two types:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Switched VCs (SVC)</strong> - It’s established <strong>on-the-fly</strong> and it’s terminated after transmission. Operational mode are CALL SETUP, DATA TRANSFER, IDLE, CALL TERMINATION.</li>
							<li><strong>Permanent VCs (PVC)</strong> -  They are preconfigured by the provider and operate <strong>always-on</strong>. Operational Mode are DATA TRANSFER and IDLE.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It is worth mentioning while we’re talking about (virtual) circuits that <strong>Frame Relay still is a packet-switching technology</strong>. VCs are used to emulate leased lines and <strong>hide the implementation details</strong> from DTEs.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>DLCI</h2>
						<p>At the DTE, each PVC is identified by a number, called DLCI (<strong><em>data link connection identifier</em></strong>). A DTE can be connected to <strong>multiple VCs using the same interface</strong>, separating flows using DLCIs.</p>
						<p>DLCIs are not unique in the whole Frame Relay WAN, <strong><u>they only have local significance</u></strong>. 2 DTEs may use different DLCIs to refer to the same connection.</p>
						<p>From the perspective of the SP, the <strong>actual path of the VC</strong> is created by a sequence of <strong>DLCI-on-input-port/DLCI-on-output-port mappings</strong> in the FR switches (any number of them through the WAN).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DLCI</h2>
						<p>DLCIs over the single links of the FR cloud belonging to a VC can be different from the ones configured on the DTEs. Again: <strong><u>NO significance beyond the single link</u></strong>.</p>
						<p>A PVC establishes a <strong>bidirectional communication</strong>.</p>
						<p>DLCIs are <strong>assigned by the SP</strong>, usually in the range 16-1007 (0-15, 1008-1023 are reserved).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DLCI Example</h2>

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Frame Relay Encapsulation</h2>
					<p>Defined at L1/L2 of the ISO/OSI stack, FR encapsulate network layer <em>packets</em> into a data link layer <em>frame</em> that <strong>uses DLCIs for addressing</strong>.</p>
					<p>To correctly reach a destination a FR DTE must specify the L3 address of the other DTE (its IPv4 address for instance) <strong><u>and</u></strong> the DLCI of the PVC that connects it to the other DTE.</p>
					<p>Consecutive FR frames are separated by the same <strong>start/end flag</strong>, 0x7E or binary 01111110.</p>
					<p><strong>L1 layers in use by FR</strong> are EIA/TIA-232/449/530, V.35 or X.21.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Frame Structure</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ss0Yw2b.gif">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>DLCI</strong> - 10-bit unique identifier for the PVC that connects the DTE device to the FR switch (or switch-to-switch). A DTE has multiple DLCIs to multiplex several PVCs on a single FR access circuit.</li>
							<li><strong>C/R</strong> - Not defined</li>
							<li><strong>EA (Extended Address)</strong> - If set, the current byte is understood to be the last DLCI byte. It allows for DLCI’s greater range in the future.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Frame Structure</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ss0Yw2b.gif">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>FECN/BECN (Forward/Bacward Explicit Congestion Notification)</strong> - Notifies of congestions upstream and downstream, respectively.</li>
							<li><strong>DE (Discard Eligibility)</strong> - If set, the frame can be dropped in the event of a congestion.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Frame Relay Topologies</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3oRZz8e.jpg" style="width: 300px;">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Topologies</h2>
						<p>The FR WAN network of the SP is like a "<em>black box</em>" through which a subscriber can create any topology it wants.</p>
						<p>However, all topologies can be reduced to 3 major types:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Hub-and-Spoke (Star)</strong> - A node acts as the central <em>hub</em> (or <em>star</em>) to which all the others (<em>spokes</em>) connect. The star doesn’t need to be in a <em>physically</em> centered.</li>
							<li><strong>Full Mesh</strong> - A topology in which <strong>every node is connected to every other node</strong>. The number of links increases expontentially, making it a clear win over leased lines.</li>
							<li><strong>Partial Mesh</strong> - Full mesh is nice but expensive even with FR, and DLCIs are limited. A <strong>mesh with a reduced number of connections</strong> is often the right answer.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Address Mapping: Inverse ARP</h2>
						<p>To be able to transmit through the FR network, a DTE must know <strong><u>both</u></strong>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The <strong>L3 address</strong> (IPv4/6/IPX/etc) of the destionation DTE;</li>
							<li>The <strong>(local) DLCI</strong> of the PVC connecting to the destination DTE.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To map them, the DTE can use <strong>dynamic</strong> or <strong>static mappings</strong>.</p>
						<p>In Ethernet networks, ARP is used when the L3 IPv4 address of a client is known and you want to request its L2 address (<em>L3-to-L2</em>). <strong>Inverse ARP</strong> is a similar protocol used to achieve <em>L2-to-L3</em> mappings, which means <strong>the discovery of an IPv4 address of a node reachable through a known DLCI</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Address Mapping: Inverse ARP</h2>
						<p>The equivalent of Inverse ARP for IPv6 is <strong><em>Inverse Neighbor Discovery</em> (IND)</strong>.</p>
						<p>A router with a FR interface will send <strong>Inverse ARP requests to all configured DLCI</strong> to dynamically populate a L2-to-L3 mapping table with the corresponding replies.</p>
						<p><strong>Inverse ARP is enabled by default</strong> on the FR interface of a Cisco router for every L3 protocol enabled on the interface.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static FR Address Mappings</h2>
						<p>It’s possible to <strong>manually</strong> associate a L3 next-hop address to a <strong><u>local</u></strong> DLCI.</p>
						<p>It’s not possible to use both Inverse ARP and static mappings for the same <strong><u>local</u></strong> DLCI. <strong>Static mappings will override dynamic ones</strong> made through IARP.</p>
						<p>Uses of static mappings include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>No support for Inverse ARP</strong> in a specific L3 protocol.</li>
							<li>To achieve <strong>spoke-to-spoke reachability</strong> in hub-and-spoke topologies (more on the reasons in the next slides).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static FR Address Mappings</h2>
						<p>The command to configure static mappings in a Cisco router is:</p>
						<pre><code>frame-relay map {protocol} {L3-addr} {dlci-num} [broadcast] [ietf] [cisco]</code></pre>
						<p>The <code>ietf</code> keyword is to be used when interfacing with a non-Cisco router, to avoid Cisco-specific encapsulation implementation details.</p>
						<p>The <code>broadcast</code> keyword is used to “emulate” broadcast behaviours on the NMBA network. Useful to <strong>simplify configuration over FR for dynamic routing protocols that assume multiaccess</strong>, such as OSPF.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Display FR Adress Mappings</h2>
						<p>DLCI format is <strong><em>decimal(0xHEX, 0xOnTheWire)</em></strong>.</p>
						<pre><code>Router#show frame-relay map
Serial0/0/0 (up): ip 10.2.3.4 dlci 102(0x66, 0x1860), static, broadcast
       CISCO, status defined, active
Serial0/1/0 (up): ip 172.16.1.4 dlci 401(0x191,0x6410), dynamic,

Serial0/1/1 (up): ip 172.16.1.5 dlci 501(0x1F5,0x7C50), dynamic,
       broadcast,, status defined, active
Serial0/1/2 (up): ip 172.16.1.2 dlci 301(0x12D,0x48D0), dynamic,
       broadcast,, status defined, active</code></pre>

						<h2>Local Management Interface</h2>
						<p>The original concept of the Frame Relay protocol took <strong>little consideration of delay issues</strong>, which are a big problem in big networks.</p>
						<p>Cisco and other vendors decided to <strong>extend FR</strong> in such a way that it could <strong>learn and react to the status of the network</strong>. These extension are known as the <em>Local Management Interface</em> (<strong>LMI</strong>).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Local Management Interface</h2>
						<p>LMI works as a <strong>keepalive</strong> between the DTE and the DCE:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Every 10s, <strong>the router polls the FR switch</strong>. It replies with:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>a simple <strong>response in sequence</strong> to the request.</li>
								<li>informations about the <strong>status of the access channel</strong>.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>If the network <strong>doesn’t respond</strong>, the DTE could consider it to be <strong>down</strong>.</li>
							<li>If the network replies with <strong>FULL STATUS response</strong>, it will contain information about <strong>all allocated DLCIs</strong> so the DTE can automatically configure all the available PVCs.</li>
							<li>Interval between keepalives can be changed with the <code>keepalive</code> interface command. It must be <strong>sync’ed between adjacent FR interfaces</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI Messages</h2>
						<p>LMI is a <strong>definition for a message format</strong> used for <strong>link management</strong> between the DTE (the router) and the DCE (the SP’s FR switch).</p>
						<p>LMI messages <strong>fits entirely in the variable-length data field</strong> of the FR encapsulation header.</p>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eAFZI2E.png" style="width: 700px;">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI Messages</h2>
						<p>DTE-DCE must use the <strong>same LMI’s message format</strong>. There are <strong>several, incompatible</strong> with each other: <strong>Cisco, Ansi, Q933A</strong>. It can be set with</p>
						<pre><code>Router(config-if)# frame-relay lmi-type [cisco | ansi | q933a]</code></pre>
						<p>It’s not necessary because new Cisco IOS releases support <strong>autosensing</strong>. LMI-type configured on a FR interface can be displayed with</p>
						<pre><code>Router# show interfaces [interface-id]
[...]
         LMI DLCI 1023  LMI type is CISCO [...]</code></pre>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI Extensions</h2>
						<p>The Frame Relay protocol itself deals with data transfer. LMI extensions take care of link management. Among them:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>VC Status Messages</strong> - Synch of PVC informations between FR devices, thus <strong>deletion of old PVCs</strong> no longer existing and <strong>addition of new ones</strong>.</li>
							<li><strong>Multicasting</strong> - Emulation of <strong>broadcast and multicasting behaviour on a NBMA network</strong> such as Frame Relay, necessary for scenario assuming multiaccess (e.g.: OSPF).</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI Extensions</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Global Addressing</strong> - An extension of FR protocol <strong>giving DLCIs <u>global significance</u></strong>, which means they can be unique in the entire FR WAN. This turns FR into a Ethernet-like protocol, enabling ARP for instance.</li>
							<li><strong>Basic Flow Control</strong> - For devices unable to use the congestion bits.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI + InARP = Complete FR autoconf</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>At first, the <strong>DTE doesn’t know about the PVCs</strong> it has access to and DTEs conntected at the other side of them.</li>
							<li>DTE sends a <strong>LMI status inquiry</strong> to the FR network, which replies with a <strong>LMI full response containing config details for every PVC</strong> available on the FR access link.</li>
							<li>DTE now knows and configures PVCs/DLCIs.</li>
							<li>The next several status inquiries are only answered by <strong>abbreviated responses containing only changes</strong> in the link status.</li>
							<li>After a <strong>set number of abbreviated exhanges</strong>, a full status reply is sent.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI + InARP = Complete FR autoconf</h2>
						<p>To map L3 addresses to the correct DLCI number, DTE sends <strong>Inverse ARP requests on every configured PVCs</strong>.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The request contains the addresses: source L3 (known), source L2 (irrelevant, will be invalid at the destination), target L2 (the <u>local</u> DLCI, will be invalid at the destination) and an all-0 <strong>target L3 address</strong> (what we want).</li>
							<li>When it reaches the destination DTE, the InARP request will be the same, but <strong>the DLCI in the FR header will be correct, <u>because it has been set to the value that, from the standpoint of the receiving station, corresponds to the sending station</u></strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>LMI + InARP = Complete FR autoconf</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>InARP reply will contain</li>
							<ul>
								<li>swapped L3 src and dst addresses, information requested by the original DTE can finally can be found in the <strong>L3-src field</strong>.</li>
								<li>also irrelevant L2 addresses.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>The catch is</strong>: the <u>L3 information is extracted through the InARP protocol</u>, but the <u>L2 information is deduced by the FR header</u>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Access Rate and CIR</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Access Rate</strong> - It is the port speed of the Frame Relay interface, and therefore it’s the <strong>data rate negotiated with the access circuit</strong>. It’s not possible to go above it, it’s the max speed of the local loop by definition.</li>
							<li><strong>Committed Information Rate (CIR)</strong> - It’s a <em>contractual</em> speed, negotiated with the SP <strong>for each PVC</strong>. If the data is sent at a rate equal or below the CIR, then it is <strong><u>guaranteed to be delived</u></strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Access Rate and CIR</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vTyz0bL.png" style="width: 600px;">
						<ul>
							<li>If <strong>data on a PVC are sent above CIR are marked with the DE</strong> (<em>Discard Eligible</em>) bit: they might probably be delivered, but also be <strong>discarded if there’s a congestion</strong>: <u>no more guarantee</u>.</li>
							<li><strong>Access rate is inherent</strong> to the purchased FR WAN service, but a CIR for each DLCI can be specified/customized by the subscriber.</li>
							<li>There are <strong>cheap FR services with CIR = 0</strong>, which means <em>I’ll deliver the data, but only if I feel like it...</em></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bursting</h2>
						<p>Sum of the CIRs for each PVC can be <strong>lower than the Access Rate</strong>. This way customer can take advantage of <strong><em>bursting</em></strong>.</p>
						<p>Bursting happens when there is <strong>unused bandwidth</strong> in the FR network, because other subscribers are under-utilizing theirs: in such scenarios, the others are able to <strong>transmit above their contractual CIR for free</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bursting</h2>
						<p>The "rate above CIR" up until the access rate is divided in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Commited Burst Size (Bc) - It is the <strong>maximum rate at which a DTE can transmit for a short time and still (mostly) expect data to be delivered</strong>. It is a parameter negotiated with the SP.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Data trasmitted at rate <u>in the Bc level are marked as DE</u>.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>Excess Burst Size (Be)</strong> - The <strong>bandwidth available above the CIR+Bc, up until the access rate</strong>. It’s not a negotiated parameter.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Data transmitted at rate <u>in the Be level are almost certainly dropped</u>.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bursting and Overbooking</h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xvq2ob9.png" style="background: white; width: 450px; float: left;">
						<p>SPs greatly benefit from bursting capabilities of WAN protocols, because they can <strong>overbook/oversbuscribe</strong>, which means <strong>selling more bandwidth to more customers than they really have</strong>, <em><u>betting</u></em> that some of them will not use it entirely and/or all the time.</p>
						<p>When in the overall FR WAN network, <strong>the sum of the CIRs is higher than the access circuit rates</strong>, somebody will pay the (lost bet) price.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Flow Control</h2>
						<p>The Frame Relay protocol has a simple way to <strong>notify DTEs that there is a congestion in the network</strong>, and therefore <strong>slow down transmissions</strong> until the congestion it’s cleared.</p>
						<p>When a DCE in the FR network detects a link as congested, <strong>for every frame flowing through the congested link</strong> it will:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Set the <strong>BECN bit</strong> on frames flowing towards the source (upstream). It is meant to <strong>notify the sender</strong> that a transmission is occured.</li>
							<li>Set the <strong>FECN bit</strong> on frames flowing towards the destination (downstream). It’s meant to <strong>notify the destination</strong> there’s a congestion.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Flow Control</h2>
						<p>In a congestion situation, linked marked as DE can be <strong>dropped as needed</strong>. DTEs can mark <strong>low-priority data as DE</strong> as a precaution.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Basic Frame Relay Config</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Set up IP addresses on the FR interface</li>
							<li>Activate the FR encapsulation on the FR interface</li>
							<ul>
								<li><pre><code>Router(config-if)# encapsulation frame-relay [cisco | ietf]</code></pre></li>
								<li>Use <strong><em>cisco</em></strong> encapsulation when connecting to other Cisco routers (and some non-Cisco), use <strong>ietf</strong> for the RFC-compliant protocol.</li>
								<li>The no version of the command disables FR and restores HDLC encapsulation.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Basic Frame Relay Config</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>In most cases, <strong>Frame Relay is already configured at this point</strong>. LMI will autosense its type and learn DLCIs through iARP.</li>
							<li>Set up the bandwidth of the serial FR interface. Useful for routing.</li>
							<li>Set the LMI type in use by the FR link. Optional, default is <strong>autosensing</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li><em>cisco</em>, <em>ansi</em> and <em>q933a</em> are supported.</li>
								<li><pre><code>Router(config-if)# frame-relay lmi-type [cisco | ansi | q933a</code></pre>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static FR Map Config</h2>
						<p>In some cases, we might need not to rely on iARP and configure the frame relay mapping manually. Optionally, we can <strong>disable inverse ARP</strong> with</p>
						<pre><code>Router(config-if)# no frame-relay inverse-arp
</code></pre>
						<p>Setup a static map requires the command</p>
						<pre><code>Router(config-if)# frame-relay {protocol} {address}  {dlci} [broadcast]</code></pre>
						<ul>
							<li><code>protocol</code> identifies the type of L3 protocol address the mapping will use.</li>
							<li><code>address</code> specified the L3 address to map to a specific...</li>
							<li><code>dlci</code>, the PVC identifier over which <code>address</code> is reachable.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Static FR Map Config</h2>
						<p>The broadcast keyword is a <strong>workaround to Frame Relay being a non-broadcast network</strong>, which is a big problem for routing protocols.</p>
						<p>When specified, the FR interface <strong><em>allows</em> broadcast and multicast</strong> over the FR interface, <em>simulating</em> it by <strong>converting it to unicast traffic</strong> automatically.</p>

						<h2>Frame Relay as NBMA</h2>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay as NBMA</h2>
						<p>Frame Relay is a <em>non-broadcast multiaccess</em> network. Broadcast not being supported causes connectivity to experience <strong>loss of <em>transitivity</em></strong>.</p>
						<p>On Ethernet, if a node A is connected to a B, and the B is connected to the C, than A can also communicate with C: they all can <u>communicate at the data-link layer level</u>.</p>
						<p>This is <strong>no longer true for Frame Relay</strong>, unless a full mesh is the actual topology. This is a problem when dealing with <strong>any protocol which assumes that multiaccess and broadcast capabilities</strong> are available.</p>

						<h2>Frame Relay and OSPF on NBMA</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>without multicast <strong>OSPF neighbors cannot be discovered</strong>.</li>
							<li>in an hub-and-spoke physical FR topology <strong>the hub must be the DR at any moment</strong>, because it’s the only one with full physical connectivity to all the routers.</li>
							<li>in multipoint logical topology (same subnet) over an hub-and-spoke physical topology, <strong>spokes woudn’t be able to reach one another</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay and OSPF on NBMA</h2>
						<p>OSPF deals with the absence of multicast on NBMA with two approaches:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>manually configuring neighbors (on the hub) and FR mappings to other spokes (on the other spokes)</li>
							<pre><code>Router(config-router)# neighbor [address_of_spoke]
Router(config-if)# frame-relay map [protocol] [address] [dlci]</code></pre>
							<li>simulating broadcast by configuring the OSPF network type and static FR mappings for the other spokes, both as <code>broadcast</code>-enabled.</li>
							<pre><code>Router(config-if)# ip ospf network broadcast
Router(config-if)# frame-relay map [protocol] [address] [dlci] broadcast</code></pre>
						</ul>

					<h2>Split Horizon over NBMA</h2>
					<p><em>Split horizon</em> is a technique used by distance vector routing protocols to avoid routing loops. It mandates that <strong>a route learned through an interface should never be advertised back on the same interface</strong>.</p>
					<p>In frame relay, when a multipoint logical topology is realized, the <strong>various PVCs are all associated to the same, physical, FR interface</strong>.</p>
					<p>Split horizon makes it impossible for DV routing protocol to work, unless it is disabled (at the risk of routing loops).</p>
					<p>This <strong>isn’t true if only a single PVC is running</strong> on the physical interface, which makes it a PtP connection.</p>

						<h2>Frame Relay Subinterfaces</h2>
						<p>FR subinterfaces are similar in purpose of router subinterfaces used for Inter-VLAN routing: they <strong>partition a single physical frame relay interface into multiple <em>virtual</em> interfaces</strong>, each associated to a single PVC/DLCI.</p>
						<p>This has positive consequences for reachability issues over NBMA networks. They allow to <strong>split the same physical topology into a series of logical point-to-point links</strong>, each on its own subnet.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Subinterfaces</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For distance-vector protocols, this <strong>solves the split-horizon issues</strong> because a routing update learned through a subinterface will be advertised <strong>over a different subinterface</strong>, not subject to the rule.</li>
							<li>For OSPF, it solves the lack of multicast in the most direct way: by making it useless. <strong>Over PtP connections</strong>, no DR/BDR election is needed and <strong>adjacencies are implicit</strong>.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This will <strong>require different subnets</strong> to each subinterface, which can be unfeasible at times.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Subinterfaces</h2>
						<p>A FR subinterface is configured with the command</p>
						<pre><code>Router(config-if)# interface serial {num.sub} {multipoint | point-to-point}</code></pre>
						<ul>
							<li>In case of PtP subinterfaces, it’s best if <code>sub</code> is specified equal to the DLCI that will run on it, to ease troubleshooting.</li>
							<li>multipoint if the routers reachable through that subinterface will be in the same subnet. Implies multiple DLCIs running on it and does not avoid the split horizon rule.</li>
							<li>point-to-point when the single DLCI that will run on the subinterface will connect a pair of routers in a separate subnet.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Frame Relay Subinterfaces</h2>
						<p>For physical FR interfaces (encapsulation is always configured on these), the distinction between PtP or multipoint operations is implicit in whether there are one or multiple DLCIs configured.</p>
						<p>Because LMI is not able to distinguish subinterfaces, DLCI must be manually associated to the PtP subinterface by running</p>
						<pre><code>Router(config-subif)# frame-relay interface-dlci {dlci}</code></pre>
